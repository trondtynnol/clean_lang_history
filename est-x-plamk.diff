> [Template merge - und] Adding possibility to first look for specific regex creation shell script before falling back to a default shell script.

> [Template merge - und] Xerox will now stop on lexc syntax errors (done by replacing lexc with xfst - it was impossible to get lexc to stop; this is also how it is done in the old infrastructure).

> [Template merge - und] Added option to automatically create a language home dir environment variable. The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give a warning). As part of this change, I switched the shell from sh to bash, as I don't know how portable the extra code is with respect to other shells. 2013-10-17T07:56:17+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Changed back the Automake requirement to 1.11 - 1.12 is creating too much trouble. We'll have to see what to do with the test output - the version requirements change must be followed by another change that will substantially degrade test reports on newer automakes. 2013-10-16T17:19:36+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Made the check for GTCORE functional, looking for both the gt-core.sh script (and using its output if found), and the environment variable $GTCORE. This means that there is no need anymore to set the GTCORE variable as long as one configure, make and make install in the gtcore directory. 2013-10-16T16:50:46+00:00

> Template merge: Remove copying of the timestamp file for non-maintainers. It breaks the automatic merge, and requires a revision-explicit merge for each such language. Also added removal of originating language tags - they are only used in TTS. 2013-10-04T07:05:34+00:00
> Added compilation of the remove-orig_lang-tags filter. Sorted the filter targets alphabetically within each logical block. Template merge. 2013-10-04T05:20:26+00:00

> Cleaned up speller fst building, removing all unnecessary inverts and streamlining the code. Prepared for the introduction of weights, but commented out for now because of bugs or inefficiences in openfst. Renamed the included hfst speller build file, to follow an emerging naming standard for the include files. 2013-06-13T14:05:40+00:00
> Added support for making variant analysers and generators using the Apertium tag convensions. The generated transducers are still not fully Apertium-compatible but they are a major step forward. Template update. 2013-06-12T13:44:33+00:00
> Renamed analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst to generator-raw-gt-desc.hfst, to make the behavior in hfst-lookup explicit and clear. Still, the "generator" behaves as the Xerox "analyser" in hfst when in comes to composition and filtering. Confusing, I know. Template update. 2013-06-11T09:48:17+00:00

> [bugfix] Corrected another copy-paste error that broke speller fst's. Template update. 2013-04-27T07:36:43+00:00
> Splitted and renamed the remove-morph-border filter. Rewrote a number of targets to reflect this. There are now three filters instead of one, to allow for more flexible fst building for speech processing. 2013-04-26T12:49:21+00:00

> Corrected a bug when building foma-based spellers. Changed one fst filename to follow the naming scheme for the new infra. Improved building of the zfst speller file. 2013-04-24T07:02:32+00:00

> [infra] We require gawk specifically, not any awk whatsoever. Improved config feedback. Template update. 2013-04-05T10:16:54+00:00
> [bugfix-infra] Corrected reference to the built fst's. Template update. 2013-03-20T17:03:42+00:00
> Updated the zhfst building to reflect recent changes in Voikko. There is now official support for zhfst speller files, but with a new location and no *.pro file. Also added simple support for local loading of the zhfst file - voikkospell requires that the file is located within a dir named '3'. 2013-03-18T09:34:55+00:00
> Further improvements to the test run output. Template update. 2013-03-13T18:26:55+00:00

> We need the last part of the path to properly identify the lexc file tested. Template update. 2013-03-13T10:16:59+00:00

> Reorganised the tools/ dir to fit better with coming development. Template update. 2013-02-26T23:24:11+00:00
> Second part of update to handle validation of generated documentation. Essentially whenever new documentation is created due to source files being changed, a forrest site is built. During that build process, any blocking issues with the generated jspwiki pages will be revealed, thus going a long way towards ensuring that such errors do not end up in svn and from there block the building of our public sites. 2013-02-21T12:57:26+00:00
> Added check for forrest as part of configuring the documentation extraction. Forrest will be used to validate the jspwiki documents during the build, to avoid that invalid documents enter the svn repository and corrupts the web page building. First step towards that goal. 2013-02-18T18:08:44+00:00

> Improved portability & correctness of conditional tests in the morphology testing. Template merge. 2013-02-14T09:13:00+00:00
> Major update to the LexC testing. Now test data directly in the LexC code is supported by the python test script morph-tester.py (it reads the lexc files directly), which solves the bugs with multiple wordforms for the same morphosyntactic inflection. It is also a bit faster than the awk solution, and allows an unlimited number of different transducers to be tested dynamically directly in the lexc code. 2013-02-13T18:24:04+00:00
> Two more source files copied from gt/sme/src/. Template update. 2013-02-11T14:10:37+00:00

> Corrected fst reference in the affixes/nouns.lexc test data. 2013-01-24T10:36:04+00:00
> Added yaml test data to the affixes/nouns.lexc file. Still doesn't produce any functional test though, looks like a bug in the awk script. 2013-01-24T10:21:22+00:00
> Fixed a syntax error in the yaml file - word forms identical with yaml (or python?) function words need to be written within quotes, to ensure they are read as strings, and not some function word. 2013-01-24T10:08:46+00:00

> generated docu 2013-01-24T08:07:17+00:00

> Added link to the generated documentation files. 2013-01-23T22:12:58+00:00

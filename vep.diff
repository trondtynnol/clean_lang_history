> Changed the path to the analyzer and generator fst's, such that the tests can be run stand-alone as well (with default transducers. It also removes irrelevant paths from and remnants of the old infrastructure. 2012-09-21T05:54:29+00:00
> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00

> Added generated lexc files to svn - to avoid compilation issues for people without java & saxon. This way the dependencies on external tools to build our linguistic tools is reduced, which is a good thing™. 2012-09-17T11:55:40+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00

The test data files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected if needed, even after a successful test run. 2012-08-29T01:34:20+00:00

> Added initial support for xml source files. NB! The support isn't fully according to GNU (autotools) standards yet, but will have to do for the moment. 2012-08-24T19:36:51+00:00
> Split out the generated lexc files into a separate variable, to be able to clean those, and only those (if needed). 2012-08-24T19:30:55+00:00
> Add more files to the source lists. 2012-08-24T18:15:55+00:00

> A first step at making the VEP lexicon compile: define all lexc source filenames, and as well define the xml sources. 2012-08-24T14:21:17+00:00
> Renamed VEP xml files, and reorganized the acronyms into two files: one for the "lexemes", and one for the morphosyntactic analysis. 2012-08-24T14:14:32+00:00
> A lot of cleanup and corrections: * suffix rules in more places (although not in all - that is not possible) * removed automake warning about pattern rules - we need them * checked all *-include.am files for consistency, added missing Xerox and HFST targets were needed, corrected vars to HFST tools, added comments and generally made the files easier to maintain (I hope). 2012-08-24T13:59:33+00:00

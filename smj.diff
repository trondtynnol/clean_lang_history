> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00

> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00

> Sometimes TABS are used between stems and continuation lexicons. 2012-09-12T08:58:20+00:00
> Added the lemma-generation tests used in SMA to SMJ. Verbs are almost perfect (one error), propers are good, and adjectives and nouns clearly have an error in the test bench. 2012-09-11T16:58:34+00:00
> Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form. 2012-09-10T10:37:35+00:00

> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00

> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00

7076a7371,7372
> Whitespace changes to make it easier to compare smj and sme, and easier to debug and change tags. Moved comments around. 2011-10-28T07:45:34+00:00
> Structured the normative compounding tags according to SMA, which has a much clearer list of them. Added the +Der tag, even though it doesn't seem to be needed for SMJ. It is still there for cross-language tag compatibility and potential future use. 2011-10-27T12:23:47+00:00
7078a7375,7376
> Cleaned up and synchronised the acro inflection and compounding of SMA, SME and SMJ. Whitespace changes to make the code more readable. 2011-10-27T12:11:35+00:00
> Corrected one misplaced colon. 2011-10-24T08:45:54+00:00
7080a7379
> More tag cleanup: shuffling things around, whitespace changes, comments. 2011-10-21T11:51:50+00:00
7081a7381,7382
> Completed the separation of the derivation filter and the focus filtering. Now focus filtering is specified in a separate, language-specific file, whereas derivation filtering (ie filtering out impossible combinations) is done by one language-independent filter. This is safe, since the der-filter is only concerned with order, and only looks at the +Der1..5 tags (and +Der/Pass[LS] - to filter out double passive derivations). 2011-10-21T11:02:59+00:00
> +Der/at and +Der/vuohta is +Der5 in SMJ. 2011-10-21T10:57:20+00:00

7084a7387,7388
> We don't trace these keywords anymore. 2011-10-18T05:31:21+00:00
> Major cleanup of the multichar tags. Now they are listed in the same order as in SME, and doublets are removed. Also replaced +Cmpnd with +RCmpnd. The CG files are updated at the same time. 2011-10-17T13:31:51+00:00

> Removed the Dummy Y6 and (Hyph) I added in a try to resolve Bug 230. Solved the bug by removing right hand context ( [ #: | Cns: ] ) from pointers involved, for example: Cns: _ Q1:0 ( X5:0 ) j [ #: | Cns: ] ; ! 1) WeG or not, e:i, X5 is added to get e:i also in ComSg.          Cns: _ Y6:0 ( X5:0 ) j  [ #: | Cns: ] ; The right hand context was for some reason disliked. I will go on and experiment a bit to see if I can put it back again. 2005-12-11T17:44:36+00:00

> Added ref to Px Sg Nom for GÅNÅGIS. Added decorative banner file-initially. 2005-07-27T10:08:14+00:00
> The Px forms Pl Nom, Gen, Ill and Com were removed, for all Px number and person forms. The reason for this is that the parser doesn't generate them, as Spiik does not give them, since they are 'sÃ¤llan' in use. If we at a given point want to introduce them into the parser, we should thus use the noun-codes.txt file version that was checked in  before this one. 2005-07-27T09:08:22+00:00

9849a12971
> Here, a => rule conflict for æ:e, and a corresponding one for e:á, were both fixed in a perhaps not too elegant way, but the compilation process was kept short, indeed. As inspiration was taken section 5.4.1 in the twolc chapter of the B&K book, and the idea was to have one "<=" rule and one "=>" rule instad of one "<=>" and one "=>" rule. The result was fine, although on the negative side comes the fact that the often complicated and multiple rule context must be written twice. 2005-07-22T11:40:30+00:00
9850a12973,12974
> Tried to fiddle a listtle with the Å, Å spell relaxation rules, but was not able to make them work. A new version is checked in, it is as sysfunctional as the old version. For the record: The trouble is that eve though all other alternations work, the Å and Å letters are not accepted as input, even though they are pointed toward ñ in this file (as they were in the previous version). 2005-07-22T11:32:44+00:00
> Changed the tag +VNoun to +Act, for Actio, and changed the continuation lexicon to K (the lexicon VSUBST was removed). Added +Act, +Act+Ela and +Act+Ill forms for the odd-syllabic verbs, and partly for the other verbs (Spiik wasn't too informative). 2005-07-22T11:29:12+00:00

9856a12986,12987
> Made reference to CONTR-OTH. 2005-07-14T14:04:29+00:00
> The rule is find, it hust had one minor error, you wrote "[ s | t ]". But s and t are shorthands for s:s and t:t, and the s in the sj potential suffix is derived from t, i.e., it is a t:s. I thus replaced the string just quoted with the string "t:", where t: means, "some underlying t, no matter how it is realised". 2005-07-12T15:36:36+00:00

> This revision has removed all conflicts in the rule file, thus decreasing compilation runtime from 2 min to 10 sec. The revision mainly concerns the CG rules, that are totally revised (all Cx:0 rules were rewritten, some of the Cx:Cy rules were kept), but also some stem vowel change rules were revised. All CG conflicts were right arrow conflicts (cf. twol chapter in Beesley & Karttunen), whereas the vowel change rules had both right and left arrow conflicts. As a rule of thumb, variables are no longer used to the left of the <=> symbol, unless the pair in question is unique (which is very seldom is). Thus, the CG rules now look like "s:0 <=> ..." rather than "Cx:0 <=> ...". As a result of all this, the thematic disposition of the present file should perhaps be dispensed of, and repalced with a disposition according to the elements to the left of the <=> symbol, e.g. ordered according to articulation place and manner. 2002-06-03T07:35:49+00:00

The diacritical symbols of the odd-syllable nouns were moved as far up as possile, and appropriate diacritics were added in certain position (there are diacritics for consonant gradation, for diphtong simplification, and for final consonant treatment, and in certain cases, the appropriate diacritic symbol was just missing, thus resulting in an overgeneration of paradigms of the GAHPER type. 2002-05-27T13:17:42+00:00
> The rule set for alternation of word-final consonants was rewritten. Earlier the default option had been alternation (after Northern Sami pattern), but this was changed for smj (partly since the processes #are# not default in smj (m can e.g. occur word-finally, and does so often), and partly since sometimes there are two different outcomes of what looks as the same underlying vowel. Thus, now h3 etc. is the set of consonants that change to j etc. word-finally. The new bigraphs were added, both to the alphabet and the sets section. 2002-05-27T13:14:27+00:00
9940a13169
> Alternating final consonants in odd-syllables were changed from h etc. to h3 etc, in order to avoid overgeneration of the corrpesonding rule. Some odd-syllable nouns were added to test out the diphtong simplification rules of odd-syllables. 2002-05-27T13:08:48+00:00

> added spellrelax file 2002-05-24T13:51:02+00:00
> Completely rewritten the section on diphtong simplification. Commented out the old rule, and made a new rule set, one rule set for each diphtong simplification, with a very inclusive context. In order to avoid overgeneration, the triggering context of the stem vowel was included in the rule (thus not only o:u as before, but rather o: and then what triggered the o:u alternation". Only even-syll contexts have been considered yet, although some contexts probably will extend to the other stem-types as well. 2002-05-24T13:50:19+00:00

9949a13187
> Renamed dummies in a principled way, cf. docu-file. Changed swedish to norwegian æ. Made a new rule set "Diphtong simplification whenever weak grade in a-stems". It works in this restricted environment, and should now be extended to the other contexts as well. The old rule set had an errouneous philosophy (it divided the diphtong simplification in two parts, and deleted 1st segment whenever 2nd element reshaping was done. In itself good, but the rule as stated opened up for overgeneration, (probably) due to the initial Vx:0 part. 2002-05-22T07:37:24+00:00

9953a13195,13196
> 30 new even-syllable verbs (BASSAT) were added, from Spiik, to document the consonant gradation pattern. The 3rd grade mark ' was removed from the upper level base forms (man'nát:man'ná replaced with man0nat:man'ná etc) for jållårit and for the contracted verbs (that do have grade III). Finally, some non-cg verbs were added to the OADDÁT (contracted) lexicon. 2002-05-21T08:19:37+00:00
> Two multi-symbol series added, h2, g2, m2, n2 and m3, d3. See twol-smj.txt for details. Links added to Particle, Interjection and Numeral, this weekends new POS. A typo added in two plural cases (elative and comitative, ij > js and js > j). "+N" added to the pointer lines to the ODDCASE sublexica (previous version gave analyses without '+N' tag. X4 removed from OTH-ODDCASE. N-CONTRWEAKSTEM was divided in tw lexica, one -S and one -J, for the two types of contracted nouns. The old one (now N-CONTRWEAKSTEM-S) works as before, but the -J one is still problematic. Finally X1 was replaced by Q2 as a pointer to I-sg12, where X1 represented plain WeG, and Q2 gives e:á stem vowel change as well. 2002-05-21T08:15:18+00:00
9955a13199
> The noun file was thoroughly revised, and now contains 3-4 times as much nouns. Subtitles were inserted representing all declension classes, and for each of them more examples were added. Especially the MUORRA lexicon was expanded, here, examples for almost all consonant gradation row was added. Odd-syllable words were added, and end-consonant patterns were taken from the Samasta grammar. There are still problems with some of the final consonants, and with the e/ä alternation. As for the contracted nouns, the s-final ones work, but the j-final ones do not yet work. 2002-05-21T08:08:16+00:00
9956a13201,13202
> Added POS Indefinite pronouns, Numerals, Particles, Interjections. Removed the ' mark from the existing paradigms. To Indefinites I added just a couple of indeclinable items, Numerals got the 1-10 series and some tentative forms for AKTA, and two empty sublexica GUOVTE- and GUOKTA-. A handful of particles and interjections were added, all from the Sámásta grammar. 2002-05-21T08:02:45+00:00

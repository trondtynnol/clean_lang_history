> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00
> The VislCG3 team has lately switched to a *.cg3 suffix. Now we do the same in the new infra - the new suffix is definitely more transparent. 2012-09-19T18:26:12+00:00

> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00

> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00
> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> Enable yaml tests by magic. Merge from the template. 2012-09-14T11:54:49+00:00
> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00

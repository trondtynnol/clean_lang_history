> The top-level syntax include AM file had not been changed to reflect the rle->cg3 suffix change. Merge from template. 2012-09-21T10:37:43+00:00
> Changed the path to the analyzer and generator fst's, such that the tests can be run stand-alone as well (with default transducers. It also removes irrelevant paths from and remnants of the old infrastructure. 2012-09-21T05:54:29+00:00
> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00
> The VislCG3 team has lately switched to a *.cg3 suffix. Now we do the same in the new infra - the new suffix is definitely more transparent. 2012-09-19T18:26:12+00:00
> Variables=cleaner code. Update from the template. 2012-09-18T06:56:51+00:00

> Added generated lexc files to svn - to avoid compilation issues for people without java & saxon. This way the dependencies on external tools to build our linguistic tools is reduced, which is a good thing™. 2012-09-17T11:55:40+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00
> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00

> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00

> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00

> Corrected syntax error. 2012-08-29T01:46:18+00:00
> Made the first test script more robust: it bails out if no transducer is found, and gives basic feedback to whether it is testing Xerox or Hfst. The test data files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected if needed, even after a successful test run. 2012-08-29T01:34:20+00:00
> Added the first test script: it tests whether noun lemmas do generate. The script does contain some language-specific bits, and must thus be adapted to the requirements of each language. 2012-08-29T00:17:53+00:00

> Added build support for xml source files: added two missing files, comment changes. 2012-08-27T07:24:38+00:00
> A split has been made according to work done in vep and myv. File names have been written to correlate with the three-way split: source lexc, generated lexc and source xml. 2012-08-27T05:48:49+00:00
> Added initial support for xml source files. NB! The support isn't fully according to GNU (autotools) standards yet, but will have to do for the moment. 2012-08-25T07:24:18+00:00
> Down-casing the names of the contlexes in LEXICON Root to correlate with the down-cased xml files in morphology/stems. 2012-08-24T18:02:20+00:00
> The names of the xml files have been changed. 2012-08-24T17:59:27+00:00
> We need to follow a strict naming convention for the common makefiles & targets to work. 2012-08-24T14:00:25+00:00
> A lot of cleanup and corrections: * suffix rules in more places (although not in all - that is not possible) * removed automake warning about pattern rules - we need them * checked all *-include.am files for consistency, added missing Xerox and HFST targets were needed, corrected vars to HFST tools, added comments and generally made the files easier to maintain (I hope). 2012-08-24T13:36:51+00:00

> _Hill Mari_ is the translation of what they call themselves. Western and Eastern Mari leaves room for the concept of a _Central Mari_. There are two literary languages: _Hill Mari_ spoken mainly in the west but also sporadically elsewhere, _Meadow Mari_ is spoken in the central and eastern settlements. Maris from Bashkortostan might be referred to as _Eastern Mari_. 2012-08-21T08:49:38+00:00

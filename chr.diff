> [Template merge - langs/und] Final step in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: removing the whole fstbased/ dir, with all subdirs. Finally! 2020-05-09T05:02:11+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fix automakefile error: no final backslash followed by an empty line. 2020-05-08T20:42:17+00:00
278a285
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step eight in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: flipping the switch. All pieces are in place for building everything in tools/spellcheckers/ only, and everything has been tested with one language, including make check (a few tests are skipped because the fst is not found, but no tests break). The old files are kept for the moment, in case unseen issues and missing data is popping up after the switch, but will be deleted after verification. 2020-05-08T18:54:41+00:00

280a289
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step six in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: moving TAGWEIGHTS out of the language independent part to the language specific part, so that we can specify different tagweight files for desktop and mobile spellers. 2020-05-08T13:24:42+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Step three in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: changing the relocated build files to adapt to their new home. 2020-05-07T16:49:36+00:00
284a297
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step two in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: copying the desktop/weighting/ dir as the default one - for most languages the mobile/weighting/ dir is just a copy of the desktop one. 2020-05-07T06:29:17+00:00
285a299
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step one in flattening the tools/spellcheckers/ dir tree: copying all subdir Makefile.am files to *.mod-* files in the top spellcheckers dir, except from the weigthing dirs. 2020-05-06T12:22:05+00:00

288a305
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed all list-based spellcheckers. There has not been any serious work in that area since the move to the new infrastructure 8 years ago. If there is a future need, we have it all in the rev history, and removing it simplifies other operations. 2020-05-06T08:43:54+00:00
289a307
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the files in tools/data/ to tools/tokenisers/, and removed the dir tools/data/. Part of the tools dir cleanup. 2020-05-06T07:11:30+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added checks for giella-core and giella-shared, symlinking to them if found, checking out (svn) or cloning (git) if not. Also removed every single reference to __UND__, it is not needed, and will cause merge conflicts. 2020-05-05T11:42:46+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] The last hyphenation build fix: now also works with other than the default fst backend, e.g. with the foma backend. 2020-04-27T08:54:50+00:00
295a317
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed a double target declaration, one from the old pattern-based build, and one from the fst build. It was a simple copy from fst to pattern, and is not needed anymore. 2020-04-27T08:04:16+00:00
296a319

305a337
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added missing quote mark „ that caused unwanted behaviour in tokenisation. 2020-04-23T07:32:58+00:00
306a339
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated references to dir names in giella-shared: requires new version of giella-common. Updated some test scripts to refer to the new dir names. 2020-04-23T06:57:49+00:00
308a342,343
> [Template merge - langs/und] The second big renaming: src/morphology/ -> src/fst/. All build, test and config files are updated. `make` and `make check` works for sma. 2020-04-22T15:49:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added dynamic construction of a regex of flag diacritics found in tokeniser fst's. The regex is used to ensure that flag diacritics are considered epsilons at token boundaries. Fixes a number of tokenisation bugs. 2020-04-22T09:31:30+00:00

311a348,349
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/ to src/cg3/, and updated all references to it. Part of the large restructuring, and a test case for more complex renaming. 2020-04-21T16:05:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More cleanup after removing src/phonology/*: all references to it have been replacecd, and the file am-shared/src-phonology-dir-include.am has been removed. 2020-04-21T07:24:39+00:00

314a355
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed documentation extraction & building to get the source doc in src/morphology/. 2020-04-20T12:09:24+00:00
315a357
> [Template merge - langs/und] The big switch: building phonology files are now changed from src/phonology/ to src/morphology. Documentation is still built in the old location, but will be moved separately due to higher conflict risk. 2020-04-20T11:39:13+00:00
316a359
> [Template merge - langs/und] Update phonology filename in src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am. 2020-04-20T07:47:35+00:00
318a362,363
> [Template merge - langs/und] Copy src/phonology/Makefile.am to src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am and src/phonology/xxx-phon.twolc to src/morphology/phonology.twolc as step one in moving the file. Then the build can switch, and finally, the old files can be deleted. 2020-04-18T15:45:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected copy-paste bug in the build steps for areal grammar checker analysers. The bug caused SMJ to fail. 2020-04-17T06:38:12+00:00
319a365
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug with multiple declarations of EXTRA_DIST and noinst_DATA in the previous template merge. 2020-04-17T06:16:29+00:00

322a370,371
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised mt/apertium make files so that fixed content is in Makefile.am, and userj-editable content is in Makefile.modifications.am. 2020-04-07T13:19:31+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Started splitting the local Makefile.am in two, by moving it to a new filename, and then create a new Makefile.am that just includes the moved one. In later commmits, some of the content can be moved from one file to the other. 2020-04-06T12:02:08+00:00
323a373
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed the remaining cases of improved upper-lower case configurable processing. Removed a variable from configure.ac with comments, turned out it wasn't needed. 2020-04-05T11:22:29+00:00
324a375
> [Template merge - langs/und] First step in fixing default case handling: downcasing of derived proper nouns can now be turned off for the standard fst's by changing a test in configure.ac. 2020-04-03T13:10:58+00:00
325a377
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in phonology compilation when there are multiple phonology files: temporary files were deleted before being used due to name overlap. 2020-03-31T07:29:06+00:00
326a379
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Automake variables to handle demanding or non-default uppercasing, or writing systems with no case distinction at all. 2020-03-30T13:48:43+00:00
328a382,383
> [Template merge - langs/und] Adding |{➤}|{•} to pmscript. 2019-12-16T08:21:40+00:00

329a385
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Makefile setting for enabling swaps in error models (ie ab -> ba). Default is no (as this used not to work, and the existing error models are based on this fact). 2019-11-06T17:23:16+00:00
330a387

336a396
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to disable Forrest validation when Forrest is installed. This reduces build time and annoying warnings for people not working on the documentation. Default is still to do Forrest validation. 2019-10-14T11:00:25+00:00
337a398
> [Template merge - langs/und] Wrapped command line tools in double quotes, to protect against spaces in pathnames. Spaces will occur when building on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux, as locations such as 'Program Files' are included in the default search path. 2019-10-10T10:54:00+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved build process for pattern hyphenators - now patgen config is done programmatically instead of interactively. The values are configured in the Makefile.am. 2019-10-03T05:57:00+00:00
344a402

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed fsttype mismatch error for filters when building mobile spellers, by building filters locally of the correct fst type, as we do for desktop spellers. 2019-05-24T09:29:23+00:00
365a430
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added UpCase function to the tokenisers, to handle all-upper variants of the input side. It does almost double the size of the fst, but at least it is just one additional line of code. Also, it does only work in Linux/using glib (for other platforms it is restricted to Latin1 - still, that covers a major portion of the Sámi fst's and running text, so much better than nothing). 2019-03-22T14:47:09+00:00
366a432
> [Template merge - langs/und] Ensure that the correct grammar checker pipeline is the default one, so that it will be executed when no pipeline is specified. 2019-03-13T08:52:36+00:00
367a434

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed dir name typo that broke compilation. 2019-02-25T18:21:29+00:00
372a442
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building an analyser tool. This is in practice an xml-specified pipeline identical to what is used in the grammar checker, but where the pipeline does text analysis instead of grammar checking. Also made grammar checkers and mobile spellers part of the --enable-all-tools configuration. 2019-02-25T17:08:10+00:00
374a445
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter to remove the +MWE tag from the grammar checker generator. It blocked generation of some word forms (and should not be visible in any case). 2019-02-13T07:50:10+00:00
375a447
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed another case of transducer format mismatch for hyphenators, this time regarding pattern-based hyph building. 2019-01-25T08:54:49+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] First round of improved handling of compilation errors in shell pipes: instruct make to delete targets when some of the intermediate steps fail. 2019-01-11T13:53:45+00:00
379a455
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure.ac conditional to control whether spellers for alternative orthographies are built. The default is 'true'. Set this to 'false' for historical or other orthographies for which a speller is not relevant. 2019-01-09T10:41:54+00:00
380a457
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fix broken hfst builds of xfscript files when there is no final newline in the source file (caused the save command to be shaddowed by the final line of text, usually a comment, so no file was saved, and thus there was nothing to work on for the next build step). 2019-01-09T09:00:58+00:00
381a459
> [Template merge - langs/und] Apply alternate orthography conversion after hyphenation marks have been removed, but before the morphology marks are deleted. Especially word boundaries are useful for certain types of conversion, but other borders will likely be useful as well. The conversion scripts need to take the border marks into consideration. 2019-01-08T09:00:11+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Replicate the desktop error model for the mobile speller, and generalise the corpus weighting compilation. Now the build code is ready for mobile speller release. 2018-12-17T17:51:19+00:00
385a463
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved Easter egg generation, using the improved script in giella-core. Increased the required giella-core version correspondingly. 2018-12-14T09:21:49+00:00
386a465
> [Template merge - langs/und] Cleaned the HFST_MINIMIZE_SPELLER macro, and also its use. No need to include push weights anymore, it is done always, for all speller fst's. 2018-12-13T10:23:33+00:00
387a467
> [Template merge - langs/und] Push weights for all final fst's, + optimise error model. 2018-12-13T10:01:59+00:00
388a469
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed how the att file is produced. From now on it should be built once, and then added to svn. The att file will usually not change, and storing it in svn will avoid rebuilding it every time. Also changed the compression. 2018-12-12T14:57:50+00:00
389a471
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for adapting the error model to the mobile keyboard layout for the language in question. 2018-12-11T14:28:15+00:00
390a473
> [Template merge - langs/und] Two more places to remove the Use/-GC and the MWE tags: mt and speller fst's. Now done. 2018-11-06T07:56:14+00:00
391a475
> [Template merge - langs/und] Had forgotten to remove the Use/-GC tag in the core fst's, only from all the others. Now fixed. 2018-11-05T15:58:02+00:00
392a477
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step 2 in blocking dynamic compounds of MWE tagged entries: moved all MWE tag processing away from the *-raw-* targets to the specific *.tmp targets. This way the MWE tags will survive long enough to be available for the blocking done in the tokeniser fst's. Tested in SME, and seems to work as intended. 2018-11-05T09:12:10+00:00
393a479
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added step 1 in blocking dynamic comounds between an MWE and another noun: added new filter that will turn the MWE tag into a flag diacritic. Increased required giella-common version number due to the new filter. 2018-11-02T11:31:21+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the whitespace analyser almost to the beginning of the pipeline, directly after the tokeniser+analyser. This is to be able to support sentence boundary detection, as the whitespace analyser will give some valuable tags for that. 2018-10-12T14:09:24+00:00
398a485
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in a configuration option - dekstop instead of desktop. Thanks to our friends in Nuuk for noticing. 2018-10-11T15:56:26+00:00
399a487
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a misplaced dependency that caused url.hfst to be rebuilt on every make, and thus trigger other rebuilds. Not anymore. 2018-10-09T14:44:02+00:00
400a489
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace tagging after the speller, to avoid that it creates trouble for the speller. That happens when whitespace error tags are applied to the word form that should be spell-checked. 2018-10-09T14:09:19+00:00
401a491
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to tag something as _only_ for the grammar checker, or _not_ for the grammar checker. Updated required giella-share version, due to new required filters. 2018-10-09T11:51:00+00:00
402a493
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace chars to the blank regex, thereby reinstating the old compilation speed. Thanks to Kevin and Tino for noticing and suggesting the improvement. Also added comment to document what incondform is supposed to contain, again thanks to Kevin. 2018-10-09T10:08:39+00:00
403a495
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed hyphen from the regular unknown alphabet, thereby reverting analysis of -foo as one (unknown) token, and instead back to two tokens. Added hyphen to alphamiddle, so that foo-bar will still be analysed as one big unknown token. 2018-10-09T08:59:36+00:00
404a497
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the tokenisation disambigutation file to the compiled and installed targets. 2018-10-09T07:36:28+00:00
406a500,501
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T17:23:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed two build bugs: abbr.txt was only autogenerated when building with hfst, and the url.?fst file was not properly generated from url.tmp.?fst. 2018-10-04T11:05:54+00:00
407a503
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in MT compilation - pattern rules are not used, but new filenames still had them due to copy-paste error. 2018-10-04T08:45:22+00:00
408a505
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering also to MT and spellcheckers. Now all tools and fst's should be covered. 2018-10-04T08:00:51+00:00
409a507
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add pmatch filtering to the default targets in src/ - duh. Now done. 2018-10-04T07:38:41+00:00
410a509
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering to the rest of the build targets in src/. Also added grammar checker filtering. 2018-10-03T10:52:14+00:00
411a511
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:47:51+00:00
412a513
> [Template merge - langs/und] More improvements to the analysis regression check: undo space->underscore from lookup2cg (to avoid meaningless diffs when comparing to the new hfst-tokenise), and removed weight info. Also changed the dir ref for abbr.txt to ref the build dir, not the source dir, as that is where the file is generated. 2018-10-01T09:58:02+00:00
413a515
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved regression check script: check that the abbr file is built, for improved traditional tokenisation; and make the patch command silent, for less noise during testing. 2018-09-29T12:13:46+00:00
414a517
> [Template merge - langs/und] Thanks to Børre, the analysis regression script will now remove diffs due to different handling of dynamic compounds when comparing old and new tokenisation. This makes it much easier to spot real differences between the two. 2018-09-25T10:18:52+00:00
415a519
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved shell script for analysis regression testing, so that in cases of no diffs it will only print a short message and continue. The test for no diff is also much faster than a real diff. Improves processing time a lot for large test corpora. 2018-09-25T06:58:11+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Implemented the option to compile phonology rules directly against the lexicon, for better rule compilation optimisations. Kevin: fixed a bug in xml generation for the grammar checker. 2018-09-11T07:40:05+00:00

Unstable or experimental tools must still be explicitly enabled. Commented out the Hunspell speller config completely, it is not supported. Corrected a comment. 2018-09-10T10:36:30+00:00

427a534,535
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure.ac setting to skip phonology compilation, typically used when compiling external sources, that provides a full analyser in src/morphology. Also added a configuration option to compile xfscript files with lexicon references in them, so allow for faster and more optimised rule composition. This variable has no effect yet, the rest of the machinery is missing. 2018-09-07T22:33:46+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Massive rewrite of filter codes and automatically generated tag conversions, all done to handle bug #2474 (URL tag not correctly formatted in the tokeniser output). The bug should be fixed now. 2018-08-30T12:52:08+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter dir and filter compilation to the fst-based hyphenators. Moved filter compilation from src/filters/ to the local filter dir (by copying the regex files and then compile them), to make the build process mostly fst format independent. 2018-08-28T11:48:14+00:00
440c555
< Updating svn ignores. 2018-08-28T10:47:06+00:00

441a557
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added dir structure and Autotools data to prepare for adding hyphenation testing. 2018-08-27T11:43:54+00:00
442a559
> [Template merge - langs/und] Downcasing of derived proper nouns was only applied on the input side, not the hyphenated side. This caused such words to be case-shifted: arabialaččat -> A^ra^bi^a^lač^čat. This is now fixed. 2018-08-27T07:55:28+00:00
443a561
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation bug where the lexicon-based hyphenator missed hyphenation points, mainly in propernouns, due to flag diacritics. Fixed by telling the fst compiler to treat flags as epsilons. Now the lexicon-based hyphenator is beating the plain rule-based one in most (all?) cases where there are differences. Must be tested better, though. 2018-08-27T06:22:37+00:00
444a563
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added comment to guide placement of local build targets (to avoid future merge conflicts), and a comment reminder about other places to change filenames. 2018-08-22T06:51:27+00:00
447a567,568
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised the source filenames to make it easy to override when needed. Should make it possible to solve the bug where src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3 overrides the same file in tools/grammarcheckers/. 2018-08-20T17:16:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Refactored repeating patterns of code with variables, fixes upload link after XServe crash last winter. 2018-08-20T10:02:08+00:00
448a570
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected and improved the compilation of the analysers including the URL analysis. This should fix the problem with compiling SMA and other languages, and should in general reduce both compilation time and analyser size. The basic change was to union in the URL analysis as the last step in building the analysers, instead of early - the early injection led to fst blowup during minimisation. Now no blowup appears to take place. 2018-06-05T12:25:17+00:00
449a572
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the special target .NOTPARALLEL to the hfst speller make file, to work around a make bug that caused a prerequisite to not be built when invoking make with the -j option. Also added some comments. 2018-05-18T13:13:02+00:00
450a574
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated command in comments to use the correct option. 2018-05-18T06:59:52+00:00
451a576
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reverted the more robust semantic tag reordering, it was just too slow. Now we are back to a less robust and more fragile system (including bugs), but with faster compilation. Ultimately we will abandon _semantic_ tag reordering altogether, and instead rewrite the lexc code to always place the semantic tags where they should be. 2018-05-16T09:10:08+00:00
452a578
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected automake (and make?) syntax error that broke compilation. 2018-05-15T11:15:12+00:00

< More things to ignore. 2018-05-14T10:33:30+00:00
---
> [Template merge - langs/und] Too eager in the previous commit to get rid of semantic tag processing: removed the filter to zero out semantic tags completely, which broke compilation of a number of fst's where semantic tags are not wanted. 2018-05-09T08:15:36+00:00
456a584
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected bugs in reordering semantic tags by doing the reordering in two steps: 1) insert the tag in the new and correct position, and 2) remove the tag in the wrong position. There will probably be things to iron out, but initial tests are fine. This should also make the whole semantic tag reordering a bit faster to compile and apply, as the generated regexes are smaller and simpler. 2018-05-08T20:34:56+00:00
458a587,588
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now that the downcasing script works in all cases, remove all the special processing, and get rid of spurious rebuilds of the dependent fst's. Another time-saver:-) 2018-05-02T10:11:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the downcasing script to work also with hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Now the downcasing script works both with Xerox, Hfst and Foma, and both with standard and hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Finally! 2018-05-02T09:22:31+00:00
459a590
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for filters for grammatical and derivation tags, sorted the generated filter list. 2018-04-23T14:47:36+00:00
460a592
> [Template merge - langs/und] Bugfix: OLang/xxx tags were removed, not made optional, in generators. 2018-04-20T08:33:08+00:00
461a594
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not delete disambiguator.cg3 and grammarchecker.cg3 when cleaning. 2018-04-19T08:50:10+00:00
462a596
> [Template merge - langs/und] Whether to let the orig-lang tags be visible in the disambiguating analyser or not is dependent on the language and the needs of each language community. Moving the removal of those tags from the general processing to the language specific processing. Step 2: removing it from the general processing. 2018-04-18T13:16:59+00:00
463a598
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the -p option to the yaml testing command, to remove all passing test. This should make it easier to spot the actual FAILs. 2018-03-08T12:53:50+00:00
464a600
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path to zhfst file. Also changed the return code when the zhfst file is not found, so that it will be reported as a FAIL. Since this test is only run when configured for building spellers, a missing zhfst file should be fatal. Also changed variable name to avoid confusion with the shell variable. 2018-03-08T11:03:17+00:00
465a602
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added phony target forwarding 'make test' to 'make check'. Required to make 'make check' work on some build systems. 2018-03-08T10:43:52+00:00
466a604
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a separate disambiguation file for the spell checker output, and a spell-checker-only pipeline (well, still tokenisation and disambigation, but no proper grammar checking). 2018-03-05T15:41:24+00:00
467a606

> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the last yaml testing scripts in the template to follow the new and improved system. No need for autoconf processing anymore. 2018-02-01T12:11:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major rework of the yaml testing framework, to be able to properly support fst type specific yaml testing (ie test only xfst or hfst transducers, or everything but xfst transducers (=foma & hfst)). This change triggered a number of other changes. The user-facing shell scripts are greatly simplified by this change. 2018-02-01T10:03:29+00:00

493a646
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify language variant, to allow testing spellers for alternative writing systems, alternative orthographies, different countries etc. 2018-01-18T06:36:58+00:00
494a648
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for area / country specific fst's for the specialised dict and oahpa build files. At the same time reorganised the build code so that targets with two variables now consistently use the fst type / suffix as the pattern, and the writing system/alt orth/area/etc as the function parameter. This should make the build system more robust by reducing the risk for accidental pattern similarity. 2018-01-17T11:38:19+00:00
496a651,652
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building area/country specific spellers. The target language for now is SMJ, but the feature is of course language independent and useful in a number of other circumstances. 2018-01-16T19:48:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed dialect fst filenames to follow existing patterns used for Oahpa fst's. 2018-01-16T14:44:17+00:00
497a654
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building dialect fst's. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a configure option. Also changed the disamb analyser to keep the dialect tags. Only normative fst's are filtered against dialect tags. 2018-01-16T12:40:15+00:00
498a656
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for building Area-specific analysers and generators (norm only). Also restored Area tags in the disamb and grammar checker analysers. Fixed missing support for Foma transducers in the alternative writing system support. 2018-01-16T07:48:28+00:00

503a666
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added weights to compounds in the language-indpendent build steps (languages without compounds will go through the same step, but will not be changed). Applied only to analysers. Also added spellrelax to the language-independent build of the analysers = it it always applied. 2018-01-12T12:01:39+00:00
504a668
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the previous fix: make sure it does not crash when the target file does not exist, and use the same test on all autogenerated tag lists. This should save a few more seconds of build time. 2018-01-12T08:34:14+00:00

507a674
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated the pipespec.xml file to comply with the newest version of the grammar checker code, where each argument type is explicitly specified. Makes for a more robust pipeline. 2018-01-10T12:05:59+00:00

509a678
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed pipespec.xml to *.in, to allow autoconf processing. This makes it possible to use modes when building using VPATHS/out-of-source builds. 2018-01-08T14:32:42+00:00

513a684
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/disambiguation.cg3 to src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3, to keep the file naming consistent (actor noun if possible), and remove discrepancy between the regular disambiguator and the grammar checker disambiguator that caused makefile troubles. 2018-01-08T05:52:54+00:00

517a690
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove semantic tags, dialect tags and other tags useful for disambiguation or suggestion generation. The grammar checker speller needs these, and they will anyway disappear when we project the final fst. 2017-12-11T13:08:14+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in piped hfst-xfst commands: in three cases the -p option was missing, causing strange misbehavior in hfst-xfst on some systems. 2017-12-01T12:09:34+00:00
521a696
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further configure.ac cleanup: moved some variable definitions to other m4 files, moved the language definition on top, deprecated GTLANG* variables for GLANG* variants (ie Giella instead of GiellaTechno). Updated copyright year. 2017-12-01T10:34:48+00:00
522a698
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved all default AC_CONFIG_FILES into a separate function in a separate m4 file, to clean up configure.ac. Some other cleanup of configure.ac. 2017-12-01T09:34:29+00:00

526a706
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for analysing whitespace and thus make it possible to tag whitespace errors (double spaces, extra spaces, etc), and also to more reliably detect sentence and paragraph borders by using whitespace as a delimiter. 2017-11-30T14:24:15+00:00

529a712
> [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the speller test scripts in devtools/ to be VPATH safe and rely on autotools for paths etc, so that the scripts will work also when only checking out single languages. 2017-11-29T13:22:48+00:00
530a714
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying language-specific files to be included in the grammar checker archive file. 2017-11-15T13:28:24+00:00
531a716
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated grammar checker files and build rules. 2017-11-13T09:50:04+00:00
532a718
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added hfst-push-weights to move transducer weights to the beginning of the strings, to enable proper optimisations of speller lookup in hfst-ospell. Stripped out most lang-specific stuff from grammar checker cg file, and added simple example rules + some explanations. Use gramcheck tokeniser in pre-pipe. 2017-11-07T15:47:41+00:00
534a721,722
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added default rule for speller suggestions, to make the suggestions survive cg treatment. 2017-10-25T09:52:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added spell checking component to the grammar checker pipeline. Now every planned component is working as it should. The spell checking requires first that one builds the latest hfst-ospell code, and then the newest grammar checker code for this to work. 2017-10-24T12:57:42+00:00
535a724
> [Template merge - langs/und] Increased weights for fall-back rule-based hyphenation. Added .hfst suffix to rule fst for consistency. 2017-10-13T07:41:39+00:00
536a726
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced the huge sme grammar checker with the more moderate smn grammar checker cg file, as the template file for future grammar checkers. 2017-10-12T08:40:18+00:00
537a728
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added note (readme file) about NOT touching the local am-shared dir, to avoid future unintended changes. 2017-10-12T06:37:15+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the missing files for a working grammar checker. Fixed grammar checker build rules to not be dependent upon enabling tokenisers. 2017-10-11T17:47:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added conversion of the analysis tags from the grammar checker speller into CG format. 2017-10-11T06:16:10+00:00
542a734
> [Template merge - langs/und] One misplaced variable caused the grammar checker speller to be built independent of the configuration. This caused a build fail for everyone. Solves bug #2437. Also added $(srcdir) in front of root.lexc, to ensure that the file reference resolves correctly in local build targets. 2017-10-10T09:37:14+00:00
543a736
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the target clean-local to the local Makefile, to make it possible to enhance the clean target with locally generated files. 2017-10-10T09:10:43+00:00
544a738
> [Template merge - langs/und] Correctiona to the grammar checker speller build: we now build a working zhfst file that can be used as part of the development cycle. Also additions to silent builds. 2017-10-04T07:00:25+00:00
546a741
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major update to the grammar checker template. It still does not work completely as it should, so hold your horses. Update content: ensured that all files needed are copied to the grammar checker build dir, removed option to name files (=irrelevant bloat), now builds an almost proper zip file, and ensured that tokenisers are built before grammarcheckers. Also made it so that when grammar checkers are enabled, spellers are automatically enabled too, as they will be included as part of the grammar checker pipeline. 2017-10-03T06:56:28+00:00
547a743,744
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the file exists test for the lemma generation testing so that it will work even in cases where multiple source files are used as input. 2017-09-20T12:00:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made cg3 file compilation more general. 2017-09-19T14:20:12+00:00
548a746
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the code to build the apertium relabel script in the apertium directory, so that we can use the actual giella-tagged fst for MT as the tag source. This should fix all issues of missing tags in the relabel script. 2017-09-15T14:15:42+00:00
549a748
> [Template merge - langs/und] GLE requires regex compilation possibilities in src/, no reason why it can't be. 2017-09-14T11:28:42+00:00
551a751,752
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a shortcoming in the build infra uncovered by gle: no explicit support for language-specific build rules that will not end up in lexicon.?fst. 2017-09-14T05:53:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved tag extraction to a separate am-include file, so that it can be shared between different dirs. Moved generation of regex for turning tags into CG friendly format from src/filters/ to tools/tokenisers/filters/. 2017-08-28T14:22:25+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] After a couple of bug fixes in giella-core, require the new version. 2017-08-25T10:11:56+00:00
555a757,758
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building tokenisers where the morphological analysis tags are given in CG format directly instead of having to be postprocess by hfst-tokenise before being printed. The idea is to make the hfst-tokenise code more general, and move everything that is particular to one language or setup go into the fst instead of being hardcoded in the C++ code. There are some issues that must be resolved, but fst-wise the code works. 2017-08-24T11:51:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building a regex that transform all tags from the format "+Adv" to " Adv" (including space). The idea is to make the tags readily consumable by CG. Both prefix and suffix tags are converted. Newest giella-core required. 2017-08-24T10:09:58+00:00
556a760
> [Template merge - langs/und] Part two of renaming the preprocess dir to tokenisers. Now all refs to it are updated. 2017-08-24T07:30:10+00:00
557a762
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed the preprocess dir to tokenisers, to better describe the content of it. 2017-08-24T06:29:58+00:00
558a764
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for diffing and merging on Linux. As part of that added checking for diff tools in m4/giella-macros.m4, and added more tests against failures. Also added test for cg-mwesplit, and increased the required vislcg3 version to the 1.0 release. 2017-08-16T10:52:39+00:00
560a767,768
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust test for the existence of the various vislcg3 files. 2017-08-15T12:21:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added more robust option checking, and a test for the existence of the specified corpus file. Also added some comments. 2017-08-15T07:17:30+00:00
561a770
> [Template merge - langs/und] Actually open the other diff views. And force-add to svn - we don't want error messages in this context. 2017-08-14T14:47:30+00:00
562a772
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected glaring variable copy&paste bug. Thanks to Trond for spotting it! 2017-08-14T12:56:47+00:00
564a775,776
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed from the default build rules the automatic removal of +Comp tags in adverbs. That is definitely not a behavior we want universally. 2017-07-02T01:38:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the check_analysis_regressions.sh script to fail if you hadn't put giella-core/scripts/ in your path - which is not automatically done when you just checks out giella-core and your language of interest. 2017-06-30T00:57:46+00:00

571a786
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed Ins() around Unknown. This triggered a bug(?) in hfst-tokenise, that caused wordforms not to be output. Speed and memory consumption should not be noticably affected. 2017-05-16T17:02:03+00:00
572a788
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved pmatch scripts - unification by reference instead of full fst unification. Reduces file size by ≈2/3, and runtime memory consumption by 50%. 2017-05-04T10:53:26+00:00
575a792

> [Template merge - langs/und] Further development of the analysis regression check: added support for diff views of all diff types, and now you can specify which diff view you want to see (and you must specify at least one). You can also override the default corpus, and specify a corpus of your own with the -c/--corpus option. Also corrected the initial description of the script in the help text, and added a diff view comparing the old pipeline using Xerox with the new pipeline using hfst-tokenise. This will help in finding unwanted differences between the two. 2017-03-17T13:38:06+00:00
582a800
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further improvements to the analysis regression check: only do function and dependency analysis if the required cg3 files exist. Also clarified the -d option and silenced the Xerox lookup tool. 2017-03-16T14:34:32+00:00
583a802
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved analysis regression check script: added a short help text, and added an option to ask for a diff between old-style (preprocess+lookup+lookup2cg) and new-style (hfst-tokenise+mwe-disamb+cg-mwesplit) morphological analysis. Intended to be used to find weak (and strong!) spots in the new-style morphological analysis. 2017-03-16T12:25:01+00:00
584a804
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the first version of a $LANG/devtools/ script that will process a corpus with the available tools, and compare the result against the previous version in the svn repository. The idea is to be able to easily spot regressions in analyses due to changes in the lexicons or CG rules. There are a number of rough edges, but it works. 2017-03-16T10:23:09+00:00
585a806
> [Template merge - langs/und] Only remove generated lemma files if the lemma generation tests succeeds. 2017-03-14T14:45:50+00:00
586a808
> [Template merge - langs/und] Only delete generated dic and tex files if one really wants to start anew. Do not delete the version.txt file, only the generated wordlist file. 2017-03-07T18:46:59+00:00
587a810
> [Template merge - langs/und] Add the url parser also to the grammar checker tokeniser. 2017-03-07T15:01:40+00:00
588a812
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make the url.hfst a dependent of the hfst tokenising analyser. Improved the tokeniser based on recent changes in sme. 2017-03-06T17:09:00+00:00
589a814
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed automatic inclusion of the url parsing fst. The union with the regular fst blew up the total, in some cases more than 10x! The preferred way of adding it is to add it in the last steps of the *.tmp.fst > *.fst processing by loading it onto the stack (and inverse it for hfst) before saving the fst stack, and thus creating a transducer file with two fst's. Applying the input to them both will in effect union them, giving the output we want without blowing up the size of the fst file. 2017-03-03T14:22:03+00:00
590a816
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for compiling a lexc file for parsing URL's as such, giving them a separate tag. Only added to the descriptive analysers for now. Requires an updated version of giella-shared, due to the new file needed for the new functionality. 2017-03-02T14:17:37+00:00
591a818
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrects an inconsistency in the order of tag changing processing, where generators and analysers got their tags changed in different order, which caused different tags in some cases.

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added final step in building pattern-based hyphenators: now also prepared for Hunspell-like OOo hyphenation. Requires new version of the giella-core. Also corrected bug in checking the version number of giella-common. 2017-02-01T11:11:49+00:00
601a836
> [Template merge - langs/und] Tex pattern based hyphenation generation works. The output must be checked and tested, and the process may have to be rerun several times to get the desired hyphenation behavior. Removed outcommented build code from the old infra - the new build code is essentially just a reformulation of the old one. 2017-01-31T14:44:44+00:00
602a838
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for checking the version of the giella-common package (aka giella-shared/). Added two new regexes to the source file list for shared regexes. Updated the required version of Hfst - it has not been updated in ages. 2017-01-31T13:57:18+00:00
603a840
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further work on the pattern based hyphenators: added tra file template, which is used to 'translate'  non-ASCII chars to ascii only for the pattern creation process. Initial build steps for the pattern build. 2017-01-31T12:29:27+00:00
604a842
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the fst-based hyphenator by removing irrelevant paths from the fst. Started work on the pattern-based hyphenator, based on code from the old infra. 2017-01-31T11:12:55+00:00
605a844
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finished first version of fst-based hyphenator: now includes plain rules as a fall-back solution (including for misspelled words), and Err-tagged forms get a high weight penalty. In general, this seems to give good hyphenation patterns if one pick the first (lowest-weight) one. 2017-01-30T13:51:44+00:00
606a846
> [Template merge - langs/und] First version of lexicon-based and fst-based hyphenation done. Works, but misses capitalised words, and does not give extra weights to Err-tagged word forms. Also no hyphenation of misspelled words yet. Hyphenation builds are off by default. 2017-01-30T12:15:03+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed logical error in the handling of negated specified fst handling in yaml tests (e.g. ~xfst) - the test didn't work, and the yaml file was run when not intended. 2017-01-18T00:33:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed regression introduced in the previous commit: one-sided tests where included when looking for test data, causing a subsequent python fail when no actual test data was found. Fixed by using a stricter file name pattern. 2017-01-17T15:52:24+00:00
618a866,867

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the removal for dialect and variant tags from the grammar checker analyser, the information can be useful when generating suggestions for corrections. 2016-11-23T14:51:00+00:00
625a880,881
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed repetition of the frequency weighted fst. The goal was to promote compounds where each part was already seen in the corpus, but it made the speller bigger and slower, and actually decreased suggestion quality slightly. — Also added code to do manual priority union, but it is buggy and outcommented for now. 2016-11-21T11:49:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added info about which file to look in to find a suitable frequency corpus cut-off location (=line number). 2016-11-18T09:44:19+00:00

628a886,887
> [Template merge - langs/und] Cleaner build steps for local speller filters - the regex is now copied in and compiled according to the fst-format of the speller as opposed to earlier, where the binary fst was compiled and then transformed. 2016-11-02T23:02:53+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] We build the tokeising analysers directly off the disamb and grammar checker analysers in src/, assuming that they are identical.

646a922,923
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for getting precompiled proofing tools libraries across the net if not found locally. Makes it actually possible to build spellers without checking out the whole of $GIELLA_HOME. Now it is also possible to just check out $GIELLA_LIBS if one still wants to build everything locally. 2016-09-09T10:37:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Applied backend format rules to the tools/mt/ap/filters dir. This is not future proof, but does not create problems for sme, and solves a bug in smj. The future problem is that we mix both a specified backend format (for compilation efficiency) with the default/unspecified format fst (for weighting) in the same dir, and we can't automatically say which filters need to be in the specified backend format and which should be in the default format. This needs further consideration. 2016-09-02T08:23:58+00:00

653a936,937

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a possibility to build fst's for alternate orthographies based on the raw fst surface forms, instead of from the default/standard orthography. 2016-08-23T20:41:06+00:00
654a939

656a942,943
> [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the code for identifying the location of GIELLA_CORE (former GTCORE). The code should be more robust, and is prepared to check against a pkg-config pc file as well. GTCORE is still used throughout the code, but in parallel to GIELLA_CORE, so that one can easily replace the former with the latter without causing bugs or other problems. 2016-08-22T20:20:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added checking for and setting of GIELLA_TEMPLATES, but only if you have defined GIELLA_MAINTAINER (renamed from GTMAINTAINER). Otherwise it is ignored. 2016-08-22T14:59:30+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the separate test for content, instead adding the test to each possible location, moving to the next location if no data is found. 2016-08-18T09:46:12+00:00
661a953
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the search order for GIELLA_SHARED data: * using --with-giella-shared=/path/to/giella-shared/data/root/dir * env. variable GIELLA_SHARED * env. variable GIELLA_HOME * env. variable GTHOME * env. variable GTCORE * using pkg-config This way it is always possible to overtide everything else using the --with option. Added comments. 2016-08-18T09:00:28+00:00
663a956
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure test to check that there is actually data in GIELLA_SHARED. 2016-08-18T08:04:20+00:00
664a958,959
> [Template merge - langs/und] The giella-shared data dir is now found using several techniques in the following order: * evn. variable GIELLA_SHARED * evn. variable GIELLA_HOME * evn. variable GTHOME * evn. variable GTCORE * using --with-giella-shared=/dir/to/giella-shared * using pkg-config If all these fail, configure errors out. Since it a.o. uses GTHOME, the change should be of no concern to existing users having checked out everything. And since the svn location is still within GTCORE, it will also work for those checking out only the core and a single or a couple of languages without any action on their part. 2016-08-17T12:59:49+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Second steps in renaming and splitting the gtcore into giella-core, giella-shared and giella-templates: replaced $(GTCORE)/giella-shared with the Automake variable @GIELLA_SHARED@. 2016-08-15T12:38:11+00:00

683a988,989
> [Template merge - langs/und] The next batch of changes to support building hfst fst's with a specified backend fst format: desktop spellers are now supported. The speller fst's will be built using the specified backend format up to the point where corpus and tag weights are added, when the fst format will be changed to the default (openfst-tropical) format. That is, even if you specify (the unweighted) sfst as the backend format, the final speller will still be weighted. 2016-06-06T10:11:49+00:00

693a1008
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for doing more targeted regex replacements on multichar sequences in parallel to the regular editdist operations. The idea is that these replacements can be applied more times (since they are few), and thus allow for more corrections of frequent spelling errors. 2016-05-18T06:37:22+00:00

696a1013,1014
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternative orthographies in spellers. Works nicely in LO, but needs more testing. Also updated the clean target. 2016-05-11T18:01:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new spellrelax system that will add an +Err/ tag (or more) to the analysis of words misspelled according to the new spellrelax rules. Can be very costly in terms of size if applied to large lexical fst's, and if many error types are tagged, so initially it is only applied to the transcriptor fst (which are used in Oahpa). Template data is from Plains Cree (crk). 2016-05-11T04:02:01+00:00

705a1029
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for hfst-based tokenisers, built on generalisations of Kevin's work. They are built using the hfst-tool hfst-pmatch2fst, which is the Hfst implementation of the pmatch tool from Xerox.

709a1037
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying backend fst format also for (parts of the) apertium fst's. One step further to speed up compilation by specifying e.g. sfst as the backend format. The implementation is a bit hacky, but will have to do for now. 2016-04-29T15:28:32+00:00
710a1039
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building glossing analysers, where the analysis tags are NOT shifted around to canonical positions. The idea is that one keeps tags and morphs together in the lexc code, and that the analyser output thus will reflect the order of the surface morphs. If one wants to build such analysers, one has to specify the final analyser filename in src/Makefile.am. 2016-04-29T13:46:45+00:00

715a1048,1049
> [Template merge - langs/und] A number of corrections to the previous commit for issues missed during the first round of testing. Now specifying an alternative backend format works correctly for all standard analysers and generators except for Oahpa-fst's. 2016-04-21T07:00:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled the new option to specify transducer format when compiling with Hfst, to speed up compilation time by using an unweighted format (ie sfst or foma). Default is still openfst-tropical, until further testing is done. 2016-04-21T05:39:18+00:00
717a1052

> [Template merge - langs/und] A typo made reversed compose&intersect seem buggy, whereas in fact it was not. 2016-02-23T14:42:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Small correction to bring the Giella version of reversed comp&intersect closer to what Miikka has: added minimisation to the reversed twolc rules. 2016-02-23T12:25:22+00:00
739a1089,1090
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to reverse the lexicon and the morph-phon rules during composition and intersection. Reduced the time needed for that operation to ≈1/3 of what it used to be in SMS, and RAM consumption went down from 11Gb to max 400Mb! Speed and RAM gains will vary from language to language. 2016-02-22T12:04:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now the lexical fst is first compiled into a .tmp file, to allow language-specific changes to be applied from .tmp to final file. More support for xfscript compilation. 2016-02-22T08:31:06+00:00
741a1093,1094
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added include to xfscfript-include.am, to let xfscripts be used in lexc compilation. 2016-02-20T21:22:17+00:00

745a1101
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added analyser-disamb-gt-desc.hfst as a noinst_DATA target, to force make to build it instead of going directly to the *.hfstol file, and thus breaking compilation when local modifications are needed. 2016-02-19T07:19:50+00:00
746a1103
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added INVERT_<FSTTECH> variables to help in improving compilation of analysers and generators for different fst technologies (Xerox, Hfst, Foma). Hfst has the inversed convention for lookup compared to the other two, and by using a variable we can now actually share the same build code irrespective of which one we need to inverse for the final analyser or generator. 2016-02-18T13:19:40+00:00
747a1105
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the remove-derivation-position-tags filter from language-independent processing, it is language-specific, and will be added to the languages needing it. This also makes it possible to do further local processing dependent on these tags. 2016-02-18T09:47:36+00:00

751a1111
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building zhfst files for mobile phone keyboards. This version is essentially the same as the desktop one, we'll start from here and adapt as we find better solutions. The zhfst file is compressed using xz for optimal file size (this is presently in violation of the zhfst specification, it must be updated soon). Also changed some of the configure options to error out when requested but without the required software installed - this is better than silently turning the requested feature off. 2016-02-04T12:09:28+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Readded the initial-letter edits in the regex - everything else is there for the initial letter machinery, so leaving it out made the build inconsistent. The default is off, with a large warning for those turning it on. 2015-12-08T16:11:41+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed --Werror from the language-independent automake file. Added a variable to make it possible to add it to the language-specific automake file. 2015-11-27T14:51:10+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to enable symbol alignment during lexc compilation for the lexical transducer. Defaults to off for now, we need to test the effect on various languages before making it default to on. Also added --Werror to lexc to make it break on all warnings when compiling the lexical fst. 2015-11-27T12:59:47+00:00

793a1184
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst is always built, to ensure we have the necessary prerequisites for all targets. Refactored the initial speller fst build to use common build code for all fst technologies. Makes it possible to easier test and compare test results when debugging. 2015-10-14T12:49:35+00:00
794a1186

799a1195
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed all minimization of the error model except for the final build step. Removed also the initial letter handling for now, it blows up the error model, and slows it down correspondingly, making spellers that has turned this on useless. For now we apply the regular error model on the first letter, that seems to work ok. 2015-09-28T17:51:46+00:00
800a1197

810a1217
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a Makefile.am variable to turn on or off corpus-based (frequency) weighting of suggestions. Default for the time being is off while we work out the best interactions between the different parts of the spellers. Changed one intermediary filename to ensure proper dependency checks and thus rebuilds. 2015-09-16T07:01:16+00:00
811a1219
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying regexes or list of string pairs for initial and final symbols in the error model. Also added a Makefile variable to control whether to allow edits of the initial letter(s), default is ‘no’. 2015-09-15T13:17:52+00:00

814a1225
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made new of a new option for the speller suggestion testing: output an attribute on each test word element containing essential info about the correct suggestion. This will support better styling of the xml file with the test data. Also changed the path to the css from the local filesystem (which will vary from machine to machine) to the svn repository web url. 2015-09-07T13:09:45+00:00

821a1236
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made one step in the speller build behave properly wrt silent builds. Removed grammar checker targets, we are far from ready for this, and it breaks 'make distcheck'. 2015-09-02T07:00:32+00:00
822a1238
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to pass a compilation option to hfst-regexp2fst. Used this variable to compile all filter regexes with the option --xerox-composition=ON. This will ensure that all filters where flag diacritics are used as symbols will be compiled correctly for proper used in later compositions. A.o. this fixes a bug where tags converted to flags to restrict compounding did not work at all. 2015-09-01T17:58:55+00:00
823a1240
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced sed expression with double cut - the sed did not work on the xserve for whatever reason, and caused the testing to hang. 2015-08-17T09:56:34+00:00
824a1242

825a1244
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added /usr/share/java/ as a search path for the Saxon jar, this is what is used on the UiT Linux virtual machines, and probably many other Linux systems. 2015-08-14T06:53:02+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved specification of default weight and editing distance to the language specific Makefile. 2015-06-05T01:43:19+00:00
834a1261
> [Template merge - langs/und] After a lot of experimenting, a moderate set of changes to the speller error models. The biggest change is that the alphabet for the edit distance error model is not taken from the acceptor anymore, but must be explicitly listed in the editdist.*.txt file. The suggestion speed is back to normal, but more work is needed re the interaction of the error model and corpus weights. 2015-06-05T01:11:10+00:00

836a1265
> [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out the old target for calculating unit weights (default weight for out-of-corpus word forms), and added a new which is basically the highest tropical weight + the ALPHA smoothing value. This is just the first step in further developing the suggestion ordering for the spellers. 2015-05-27T14:55:29+00:00
837a1267
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a simple test to check a minimum suggestion speed for our test word nuvviDspeller. No speller should be released that does not pass this test. Additional and more elaborate tests should be added as well, this is just the very bare minimum in suggestion speed testing. 2015-05-25T14:08:25+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Extended Foma support to alternate writing systems and orthographies. At the same time put to use a new idiom to handle multiple independent target variables / patterns, which will be useful in other contexts as well. The code was generalised using this new idiom, and effectively reduced to half the original code size, with much less duplicate code. 2015-05-15T09:07:02+00:00
846a1283

> [Template merge - langs/und] First steps to support building with Foma. Lexicon compilation is working, but note that Foma crashes on regexes in lexc. 2015-05-08T15:17:42+00:00
848a1287
> [Template merge - langs/und] Slightly more robust pair-testing with hfst. 2015-04-27T12:46:42+00:00
849a1289
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected rsynk options also for the alternate writing system oxt's. 2015-04-27T09:30:06+00:00
850a1291
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a build bug for MacVoikko, causing the final target to always be out of date. Regulated verbosity for zhfst targets. The twolc testing scripts now print a message when there is no test data. The Hfst twolc testing script properly detects when there is no test data, and exits with the SKIP (77) value. 2015-04-27T09:06:25+00:00
851a1293
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternate writing systems for spellers. 2015-04-24T19:04:49+00:00

853a1297
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further modularisation and improvements to weighted spellers. With hfst3 revision 4329, using a tab-separated tag reweighting file is working. 2015-04-21T11:47:05+00:00
854a1299
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove usage tags when building spellers, speller tags were throwned out. 2015-04-16T09:55:55+00:00
855a1301
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an attempt at normalising the corpus-based weights towards a standard max upper weight, to allow a much higher weight for strings not to be suggested. Also split the processing of adding corpus-based weights and morphology weights into more steps - retaining each intermediate fst - to allow easier debugging of the weight assignments. 2015-04-16T08:24:24+00:00

858a1307
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bugs related to the new support for frequency-weighted spellers: missing checks for required tools. 2015-04-10T11:14:50+00:00

864a1317
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for corpus-based (frequency) weighting of the speller fst's. Also reorganised where to specify the tag-based weights (and this is subject to change pending a bug fix in hfst-reweight). All languages are given a toy corpus, which can be replaced with a real one. This is finally the core of Tommi's dissertation applied to all languages. 2015-04-09T09:48:58+00:00
866a1320

867a1322
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected tests for nouns and propernouns. Now nouns behave correctly with hfst, and proper nouns have correct tags. 2015-04-07T06:59:56+00:00
868a1324
> [Template merge - langs/und] Modernised the generate-noun-lemmas.sh.in script, added similar scripts for adj, proper nouns and verbs. 2015-04-02T06:27:37+00:00

876a1338
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new directory named devtools/ to each language, with the idea that it should contain tools useful for development, but not necessarily suitable for automake testing. Initially it contains shell scripts to generate a table of generated word forms for each continuation lexicon. 2015-03-13T11:21:36+00:00
877a1340
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed corpus names from tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/hfst/data/Makefile.am. It caused the build to stop with an error for all languages except FIN. 2015-03-12T08:50:49+00:00

888a1356
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for a new type of yaml tests: speller acceptance testing. The basic idea is to just give a list of words and word constructions (compounds, derivations, etc) the speller should accept or reject, and let the yaml test bench verify whether this is actually the case. 2015-03-06T13:29:54+00:00
890c1358
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-06T09:24:00+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Several changes to properly support all position-based +CmpN/XX tags: * moved tag path splitting and tag-to-flag conversion into separate regex files in the core. * added support for compiling and using the new regexes * added support for a new type +CmpN/Suff * added the required multichar symbols to the root.lexc files * increased required core version number 2015-03-05T15:48:07+00:00
891a1360
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the yaml test bench when both hfst and xfst was enabled, but where only one type is built, e.g. for Apertium. 2015-03-05T14:12:35+00:00
892a1362
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added build support for alternate orthographies: default fst's, dicts and oapha. 2015-03-04T15:51:40+00:00
893a1364
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the wrong fst to be picked in certain cases, which caused the test script to fail. 2015-03-04T10:58:15+00:00
894a1366
> [Template merge - langs/und] A couple of changes related to testing: * require Python 3.3+ * require new gtcore * update YAML test runner to make SMS testing work as intended also with Xerox 2015-03-03T16:42:49+00:00

899a1374
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configuration flag to enable two-step compose-intersect. In most cases this will not make any difference, but for some languages it will correct a bug in compose-intersect that would otherwise create a bad fst, and for other languages it will make the operation much slower without changing the fst. Disabled by default, whether it is useful must be tested in each case / language. 2015-02-27T09:21:50+00:00

903a1382
> [Template merge - langs/und] First step in adding support for alternate writing systems and orthographies: adding variables to configure.ac. Removed the variable LO_min_version, it isn't used. 2015-02-25T06:54:29+00:00
904a1384
> [Template merge - langs/und] Split the m4/ax_python_module.m4 file, it contained mostly java autotools stuff. Improved the message to update the gtcore. 2015-02-24T15:20:24+00:00
905a1386

909a1394
> [Template merge - langs/und] Require new core because of new filters. Use hfst-optimized-lookup in the yaml testing (but only if possible), this should speed up hfst testing quite a bit. 2015-02-11T21:49:36+00:00
910a1396

918a1412
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed 'invert net' from a couple of more instances. 2015-02-09T17:01:44+00:00
919a1414
> [Template merge - langs/und] Treat Hfst and Xerox the same during *tmp.Xfst and *.Xfst build - invert both only in the last step when going from tmp to non-tmp fst (invert the analyser for hfst, the generator for xfst). This should remove one more confusing difference between the two. 2015-02-09T15:34:18+00:00
920a1416
> [Template merge - langs/und] Check that we have at least Python3.1 when enabling Apertium, error out if not. Also add AM check for hfst-optimized-lookup. 2015-02-09T14:47:56+00:00

929a1434
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finally nailed all combinations of fst compilator and lexicon minimisation - now downcasing of derived proper nouns is working as it should again for both Xerox, Hfst hyperminimised and Hfst normal lexc compilation. 2015-01-27T15:38:42+00:00
930a1436

931a1438
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved code common to all yaml testrunner shell scripts to an include file in GTCORE to avoid code duplication and reduce the risk for introducing bugs. This requires the newest version of the CORE. Because of the inclusion, I had to rename the test runner to .sh.in, and added autoconf processing of it. Also added a test file for testing the base speller fst (it must be tailored to each language of course). 2015-01-26T15:33:56+00:00

934a1442
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added optional flag diacritic inserted by Hfst hyperminimisation. This resolves the remaining cases of errors after the hfst team fixed a bug in lexc compilation with hyperminimisation turned on. Since it is optional, it does not make any harm when using Xerox or when not using hyperminimisation. 2015-01-22T08:42:30+00:00
935a1444
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added xerox variable flag-is-epsilon to the tag reorder regex. This fixes most of the cases of errors after the hyperminimisation bug was fixed in hfst-lexc. The remaining errors must be fixed in the downcase-derived-proper regex. 2015-01-22T07:21:19+00:00

937a1448
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added conversion of tags to flag diacritica for position-restricting tags. These are currently used in sma, sme, smj and sje. Together with some additions to the R lexicon, the tags will finally do what they are meant to do for hfst-based spellers. 2015-01-20T09:16:17+00:00
938a1450
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Multichar symbol definitions for flag diacritica controlling compounding based on position tags. Done for most langs, the symbols will be ignored if not used. 2015-01-19T21:29:59+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Changed Hfst configuration: * moved xerox check before hfst check to ... * automatically enable hfst if the Xerox tools are not found * moved minimum version requirement definition to configure.ac * removed hfst-foma requirement, instead checking for all required tools * removed path check for obsolete hfst tools * improved hfst configuration messages * updated the summary text to reflect that hfst is automatically enabled These changes should ease configuration on systems without Xerox. 2014-10-28T22:27:33+00:00
964a1495
> [Template merge - und] Corrected names of compiled twolc files in test/src/phonology/pair-test*.sh.in. We need to use the 'compose' fst because compiled twolc files are not treated the same as other fst's. We can't just skip the new lookup-friendly filenames either, because morphophonological rules can be written using xfscript, in which case the lookup renaming (and inversion) is essential. 2014-10-27T15:11:42+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Now both general and language-pair specific relabelling using regexes are supported, in addition to using relabel files. The regexes allow context-dependent and multisymbol changes, whereas the relabel files only cover 1:1 mappings of single symbols. The actual change was to add support for regex files in the language-pair independent processing. The tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/README.txt file was more or less completely rewritten to better document the filenames being recognised, and how they should be used. 2014-10-23T06:15:55+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Retain the regular non-optimised hfst analyser for easy paradigm generation using a regex plus composition. 2014-10-21T11:02:19+00:00
969a1503
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug in the Apertium build that blocked building of AP-tagged analysers. 2014-10-20T19:14:52+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Make sure there is always an apertium analyser for 'und' if nothing else. 2014-10-20T14:41:04+00:00
971a1507
> [Template merge - und] Do not remove homonymy tags from the apertium fst's. Also simplified the automatic conversion by moving all non-automatic changes to a separate file, run as a sort of tag conversion postprocessing. Updated the tagset/README.txt file to contain info aobut the manually maintained postprocessing relabel file. Added an initial postprocessing relabel file containing word boundary and homonymy tag changes. 2014-10-14T19:22:50+00:00

974a1513
> [Template merge - und] Moved Apertium tagset creation and relabeling from src/tagsets/ to tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. This should fix building of apertium fst's for fin, smn. 2014-10-10T14:28:42+00:00
975a1515
> [Template merge * 2 - und] 1) Improved test for gnu awk. 2) Renamed AWK to GAWK in relevant places to get around another AWK test. Now gawk is found properly in all cases. 2014-10-09T11:02:07+00:00

979a1522
> [Template merge - und] Hfst 3.8.0 is out, with a number of important bug fixes and improvements, including new options required to make our code build properly. 2014-10-04T07:16:41+00:00
980a1524
> [Template merge - und] Several changes to accomodate a downcaseerror variant of the L2 error fst for Oahpa: * added configure.ac option --enable-downcaseerror (independent of the L2 opt) * a number of changes to the build instructions for Oahpa to support the new fst * made the error fst compilation independent of whether an L2 twolc/xfscript file is used - if not, it will just use the ordinary twolc/xfscript file. This way it is possible to build a downcaseerror fst without starting L2 development. * svn-copied regexes from the old to the new infra, including to the core * increased gtcore version number and required version number due to new regexes 2014-10-02T14:34:27+00:00
981a1526
> [Template merge - und] Corrected wrong filenames and file references that blocked the oahpa L2 build. 2014-10-02T06:39:24+00:00
982a1528
> [Template merge - und] Tagset relabeling didn't work for xfst files, now it does. Also generalised the use of relabel files (for use with hfst-relabel). 2014-10-02T06:24:06+00:00
983a1530
> [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of hfst's with alternative tagsets, now that the *.hfst files are not in optimised lookup format. Silenced regex compilation. 2014-10-01T14:44:20+00:00
985a1533
> [Template merge - und] Last part of the lookup & composition cleanup: phonetics and phonology now covered. Now all non-lexical and non-filter files have a suffix .compose.* or .lookup.* depending on their intended use, and they are all properly inverted where needed (i.e. only for Xerox' lookup tool). There might still be source files to clean, but that is a separate step. 2014-09-30T22:55:10+00:00
986a1535
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a couple of cases where old filenames were still used, and thus broke compilation. Also improved filtering of transcriptors, and constructed transcriptor target names dynamically based on the source files. 2014-09-30T21:30:41+00:00
987a1537
> [Template merge - und] Xfscript and lookup cleanup: now we explicitly build files made for lookup and composition marked in the filenames. This is done for hyphenation and for orthography, phonology and phonetics still to be done. From now on there should be no need to use invert as part of the xfscript code - DON'T DO IT! All targets updated to use the new filenames. Removed inversion from the hyphenation xfscript. 2014-09-30T19:54:37+00:00
988a1539,1540
> [Template merge - und] Use explicit pipe mode with hfst-xfst. 2014-09-30T10:50:52+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved Apertium target language specification from configure.ac to tools/mt/apertium/Makefile.am. Changed the target filename construction to better follow the Apertium naming scheme. Fixed a bug introduced about four weeks ago that destroyed the dependency chain (due to a bug/fragileness in GNU make). 2014-09-30T10:37:59+00:00
990a1543
> [Template merge - und] Cleaned up building of target fst's using the lookup-include.am file. Now all hfst transducers in optimised lookup format have the suffix .hfstol, and optimisation should not be hidden or implisit anymore. All test scripts should be updated as well. Also move all common targets from src/Makefile.am to am-shared/src-dir-include.am and sub-included AM files. This cleans up the src/ dir Makefile.am quite a lot. 2014-09-29T21:22:26+00:00
991a1545
> [Template merge - und] Added support for additional local lexc files not part of the lexical fst. 2014-09-29T11:51:44+00:00
992a1547
> [Template merge - und] Several changes to clean up the mess with the transcriptors: * moved transcriptor final builds from src/ to src/transcriptions/ * renamed transcriptor source files and targets * streamlined transcriptor compilation to use lexc-include and lookup-include * also silenced xfst in lookup-include.am 2014-09-27T10:35:34+00:00
993a1549
> [Template merge * 2 - und] There were a couple of issues in the previous commit: * vpath directive didn't work reliably * L1 and L2 variabless were declared for easy merging, but in a way that AM didn't like * forgot to change the name of the lexical fst in the filter processing 2014-09-24T12:17:05+00:00
996a1553
> [Template merge - und] Added support for filters written in lexc and xfscript. Renamed variables and added a lexc-include.am file to support general lexc compilation. 2014-09-22T12:19:48+00:00
997a1555
> [Template merge - und] Fixed an unfortunate AM syntax error that blocked Automake, and thus all builds. 2014-09-20T10:04:31+00:00
998a1557
> [Template merge - und] Three template updates at once: * Cleaned the filter build files even more. Now only local / language specific regex source files need to be listed in the local Makefile.am. * Fixed a problem with MT filter compilation that only revealed itself in sme. * Another filter build cleanup: all filter regexes in core are now built for all languages. One obsolete filter was removed. 2014-09-18T17:43:37+00:00
999a1559
> [Template merge - und] Added a new filter to the filter compilation. Used the new filter to build correct fst's for dictionary analysis and generation. Increased the version number of the required gtd core version, due to the new and required filter in the core. 2014-09-18T07:45:56+00:00
1000a1561
> [Template merge - und] Major cleanup of filter and tagset compilation: * moved all non-local data and build instructions into am-shared/ * created dir-specific am-include files * clean use of regex-include.am * removed sme-specific source files from tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/Makefile.am * switched the apertium filter use to use the one built in src/filters/ instead of rebuilding it 2014-09-17T11:52:42+00:00
1001a1563
> [Template merge - und] analyser-oahpa-gt-desc should be analyser-oahpa-gt-norm. Now renamed. 2014-09-15T17:03:46+00:00
1002a1565
> [Template merge - und] The listbased speller fst is now generated properly using both Xerox and Hfst. 2014-09-15T13:00:26+00:00
1003a1567
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a logical error that turned off all hfst spellers. Renamed a variable. 2014-09-15T10:03:01+00:00
1004a1569
> [Template merge - und] Only build Apertium tagsets in tools/mt/ if Apertium is turned on. 2014-09-15T08:41:49+00:00
1005a1571
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a syntax error in the src_disamb-include.am file. Moved all fst trimming of general interest from tools-spellcheckers-listbased to tools-spellcheckers. Made the configuration so that list-based spellers will only compile if configured to build Hunspell. Also tried to make the configuration of other spellers such that they are automatically off when spellers are off. 2014-09-15T06:04:55+00:00
1006a1573
> [Template merge - und] Downcasing of the initial letter of derived proper nouns (Pariisi -> pariisilainen) is now finally working with Hfst. It requires Hfst svn rev. 4000. 2014-09-12T10:36:40+00:00
1009c1576
< Updated svn:ignore's. 2014-09-08T21:51:28+00:00
---
> [Template merge - und] The first major step for adding support for generating list-based spellers such as Hunspell and the PLX (Polderland/MS Word) spellers. The conversion is not trivial, since we try to control compounding according to the linguistic specifiation in the lexicon (using tags). Although PLX is only for three Sámi languages, Hunspell conversion should be useful for all languages in our infrastructure. No real Hunspell or PLX files produced yet, only prerequisite fst's. - At the same time fixed a glitch in the version checking of VislCG3 that would turn off support for CG files now that the vislcg3 svn revision number has turned 10 000. 2014-09-08T21:33:54+00:00
1010a1578
> [Template merge - und] Added support for local overrides of the base speller fst. 2014-09-05T20:55:33+00:00
1011a1580
> [Template merge - und] Generalised and simplified the code for building oxt's - no more hard-coded filenames. Now the LO-voikko versions supported as well as the platforms are just defined in two variables, and the rest follows from there. The build code also handles cases of unsupported combinations of voikko versions and platforms. Also silenced the build quite a lot in non-verbose mode. 2014-09-04T08:23:38+00:00
1012a1582
> [Template merge - und] Switched to universal binary build for the LO41 voikko OXT. 2014-09-02T10:13:12+00:00
1013a1584
> [Template merge - und] Made the hfst optimised lookup file format explicit by using the .hfstol suffix, and by optimising files for lookup in a separate build step, instead of implicitly as before. So far only for tools/mt/apertium/, but more will come. Removed the removal of semantic tags - they are already optional, which should be more flexible and robust. 2014-08-27T11:58:27+00:00
1014a1586
> [Template merge - und] Made speller minimisation default to yes, specified where to push weights. 2014-08-26T07:08:16+00:00
1015a1588
> [Template merge - und] Added --encode-weights to determinise and minimise. This fixed the never-ending compilation of Finnish spellers. 2014-08-25T14:32:36+00:00
1016a1590
> [Template merge - und] The optimisations that worked for Greenlandic didn't work for Finnish, potentially due to Finnish being corpus-weighted and thus posing more challenges to determinisation and minimisation. Because of this the Greenlandic optimisation is now rolled into the configuration option --enable-minimised-spellers, OFF by default. 2014-08-22T17:40:51+00:00
1017a1592
> [Template merge - und] Added size and speed optimisations to the speller compilation process: remove-epsilons, push-weights, determinise and minimise. Together this made the KAL speller *much* smaller and *much* faster. It is now as fast and small as any other fst-based speller. 2014-08-22T09:32:19+00:00
1018a1594
> [Template merge - und] Hyperminimisation seems to be stable now, and I have added it as a standard configuration option. Also added autoconf support for the preliminary tool hfst-proc2, to facilitate easier testing of the tokeniser/analyser. 2014-08-21T08:51:07+00:00
1019a1596
> [Template merge - und] Updated the tagset targets to support Xerox fst's, and tagset replacement using regexes instead of the hfst-only relabel tool. Now all languages can get localised analysis and generation tags by adding a regex file and specifying a few targets. 2014-08-19T16:43:15+00:00
1020a1598
> [Template merge - und] Added build step to explicitly convert hfst transducers to optimised lookup format. Whitespace changes in the silent rule variables. Included the new lookup-include file in src-dir-include.am. 2014-08-19T11:34:06+00:00
1021a1600
> [Template merge - und] Preparations for better handling of lookup & testing of free-standing lexc and rewrite rule transducers: added build rules to do inversion of fst's intended for lookup. 2014-08-19T07:53:39+00:00
1022a1602

> [Template merge - und] Brought all start-up langs in line with the und template, merging in the following revisions (some languages only merged a subset of these, as they have a more recent baseline from the previous merge or creation): 2014-08-08T06:58:04+00:00

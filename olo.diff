> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00

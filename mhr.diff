> [Template merge - langs/und] Had forgotten to remove the Use/-GC tag in the core fst's, only from all the others. Now fixed. 2018-11-05T15:57:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step 2 in blocking dynamic compounds of MWE tagged entries: moved all MWE tag processing away from the *-raw-* targets to the specific *.tmp targets. This way the MWE tags will survive long enough to be available for the blocking done in the tokeniser fst's. Tested in SME, and seems to work as intended. 2018-11-05T09:10:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added step 1 in blocking dynamic comounds between an MWE and another noun: added new filter that will turn the MWE tag into a flag diacritic. Increased required giella-common version number due to the new filter. 2018-11-02T11:16:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug when building the punctuation file - the required subdir was not made. 2018-10-24T08:39:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the whitespace analyser almost to the beginning of the pipeline, directly after the tokeniser+analyser. This is to be able to support sentence boundary detection, as the whitespace analyser will give some valuable tags for that. 2018-10-12T14:07:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in a configuration option - dekstop instead of desktop. Thanks to our friends in Nuuk for noticing. 2018-10-11T15:55:10+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a misplaced dependency that caused url.hfst to be rebuilt on every make, and thus trigger other rebuilds. Not anymore. 2018-10-09T14:42:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace tagging after the speller, to avoid that it creates trouble for the speller. That happens when whitespace error tags are applied to the word form that should be spell-checked. 2018-10-09T14:08:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to tag something as _only_ for the grammar checker, or _not_ for the grammar checker. Updated required giella-share version, due to new required filters. 2018-10-09T11:50:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace chars to the blank regex, thereby reinstating the old compilation speed. Thanks to Kevin and Tino for noticing and suggesting the improvement. Also added comment to document what incondform is supposed to contain, again thanks to Kevin. 2018-10-09T10:08:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed hyphen from the regular unknown alphabet, thereby reverting analysis of -foo as one (unknown) token, and instead back to two tokens. Added hyphen to alphamiddle, so that foo-bar will still be analysed as one big unknown token. 2018-10-09T08:58:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the tokenisation disambigutation file to the compiled and installed targets. 2018-10-09T07:31:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T17:23:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed two build bugs: abbr.txt was only autogenerated when building with hfst, and the url.?fst file was not properly generated from url.tmp.?fst. 2018-10-04T11:04:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in MT compilation - pattern rules are not used, but new filenames still had them due to copy-paste error. 2018-10-04T08:43:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering also to MT and spellcheckers. Now all tools and fst's should be covered. 2018-10-04T07:59:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add pmatch filtering to the default targets in src/ - duh. Now done. 2018-10-04T07:32:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering to the rest of the build targets in src/. Also added grammar checker filtering. 2018-10-03T10:42:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:47:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More improvements to the analysis regression check: undo space->underscore from lookup2cg (to avoid meaningless diffs when comparing to the new hfst-tokenise), and removed weight info. Also changed the dir ref for abbr.txt to ref the build dir, not the source dir, as that is where the file is generated. 2018-10-01T09:57:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved regression check script: check that the abbr file is built, for improved traditional tokenisation; and make the patch command silent, for less noise during testing. 2018-09-29T12:13:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Thanks to Børre, the analysis regression script will now remove diffs due to different handling of dynamic compounds when comparing old and new tokenisation. This makes it much easier to spot real differences between the two. 2018-09-25T10:10:13+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved shell script for analysis regression testing, so that in cases of no diffs it will only print a short message and continue. The test for no diff is also much faster than a real diff. Improves processing time a lot for large test corpora. 2018-09-25T06:57:58+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter dir and filter compilation to the fst-based hyphenators. Moved filter compilation from src/filters/ to the local filter dir (by copying the regex files and then compile them), to make the build process mostly fst format independent. 2018-08-28T11:48:12+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation bug where the lexicon-based hyphenator missed hyphenation points, mainly in propernouns, due to flag diacritics. Fixed by telling the fst compiler to treat flags as epsilons. Now the lexicon-based hyphenator is beating the plain rule-based one in most (all?) cases where there are differences. Must be tested better, though. 2018-08-26T17:13:32+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected and improved the compilation of the analysers including the URL analysis. This should fix the problem with compiling SMA and other languages, and should in general reduce both compilation time and analyser size. The basic change was to union in the URL analysis as the last step in building the analysers, instead of early - the early injection led to fst blowup during minimisation. Now no blowup appears to take place. 2018-06-05T12:25:12+00:00

Now we are back to a less robust and more fragile system (including bugs), but with faster compilation.

There will probably be things to iron out, but initial tests are fine. This should also make the whole semantic tag reordering a bit faster to compile and apply, as the generated regexes are smaller and simpler. 2018-05-08T18:26:25+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building tokenisers where the morphological analysis tags are given in CG format directly instead of having to be postprocess by hfst-tokenise before being printed. The idea is to make the hfst-tokenise code more general, and move everything that is particular to one language or setup go into the fst instead of being hardcoded in the C++ code. There are some issues that must be resolved, but fst-wise the code works. 2017-08-24T11:51:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building a regex that transform all tags from the format "+Adv" to " Adv" (including space). The idea is to make the tags readily consumable by CG. Both prefix and suffix tags are converted. Newest giella-core required. 2017-08-24T10:09:48+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Further development of the analysis regression check: added support for diff views of all diff types, and now you can specify which diff view you want to see (and you must specify at least one). You can also override the default corpus, and specify a corpus of your own with the -c/--corpus option. Also corrected the initial description of the script in the help text, and added a diff view comparing the old pipeline using Xerox with the new pipeline using hfst-tokenise. This will help in finding unwanted differences between the two. 2017-03-17T12:48:36+00:00
> Added name pairs. 2017-03-17T12:32:34+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further improvements to the analysis regression check: only do function and dependency analysis if the required cg3 files exist. Also clarified the -d option and silenced the Xerox lookup tool. 2017-03-16T14:34:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved analysis regression check script: added a short help text, and added an option to ask for a diff between old-style (preprocess+lookup+lookup2cg) and new-style (hfst-tokenise+mwe-disamb+cg-mwesplit) morphological analysis. Intended to be used to find weak (and strong!) spots in the new-style morphological analysis. 2017-03-16T12:21:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the first version of a $LANG/devtools/ script that will process a corpus with the available tools, and compare the result against the previous version in the svn repository. The idea is to be able to easily spot regressions in analyses due to changes in the lexicons or CG rules. There are a number of rough edges, but it works. 2017-03-16T10:12:06+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed automatic inclusion of the url parsing fst. The union with the regular fst blew up the total, in some cases more than 10x! The preferred way of adding it is to add it in the last steps of the *.tmp.fst > *.fst processing by loading it onto the stack (and inverse it for hfst) before saving the fst stack, and thus creating a transducer file with two fst's. Applying the input to them both will in effect union them, giving the output we want without blowing up the size of the fst file. 2017-03-03T14:19:52+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Finished first version of fst-based hyphenator: now includes plain rules as a fall-back solution (including for misspelled words), and Err-tagged forms get a high weight penalty.

> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot one file in the previous commit - now that filter is completely removed from the core and template, and all language-independent processing. 2016-11-01T10:36:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the remove-norm-comp-tags.regex file from the giella-shared directory to the languages actually using it, and consequently removed it from the language-independent build files. 2016-11-01T10:25:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated the speller devtools scripts to obey the new name and location of the giella-core directory. 2016-10-26T13:37:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added test for available GNU Make, and at least at version 3.82. Error if not found, except on OSX/macOS, where the builtin make is GNU Make 3.81 + patches, which corresponds to the required version or newer. 2016-10-26T12:27:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better support for speller filters using source files from other locations. 2016-10-20T14:31:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added mwe-dis.cg3, to allow disambiguation of multiword expressions and other tokenisation ambiguity. 2016-10-18T08:37:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] We build the tokeising analysers directly off the disamb and grammar checker analysers in src/, assuming that they are identical. This is a reasonable assumption now that the hfst tool kit contains all necessary machinery, and we don't need to pay special attention to the requirements of the tokenisation. 2016-10-17T07:29:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make --with-backend-format work also for the tokenising analysers. 2016-10-17T06:43:07+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Wrong variable name :-( - now it is correct. 2016-10-10T14:59:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected makefile dependency for the und.timestamp file. 2016-10-10T14:50:11+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robustness added to the test scripts: checking several variables, testing whether the found variables are pointing to existing directories, and giving an error message if no directory is found. 2016-10-06T15:25:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed variable name and definition to allow overriding the path to the called script, to make it easy to use a locally modified script instead. 2016-10-04T13:49:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed variable name in devtool scripts, to reflect similar changes elsewhere. Part of fixing bug #2219. 2016-10-04T08:53:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a number of bugs and deficiencies when building spellers when the giella proofing tools libraries must be fetched over the net. Not the spellers build correctly under all intended circumstances given that there is a network connection. 2016-09-09T16:12:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path for the test for availability of the giella-common resources. 2016-09-09T11:33:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for getting precompiled proofing tools libraries across the net if not found locally. Makes it actually possible to build spellers without checking out the whole of $GIELLA_HOME. Now it is also possible to just check out $GIELLA_LIBS if one still wants to build everything locally. 2016-09-09T10:37:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Applied backend format rules to the tools/mt/ap/filters dir. This is not future proof, but does not create problems for sme, and solves a bug in smj. The future problem is that we mix both a specified backend format (for compilation efficiency) with the default/unspecified format fst (for weighting) in the same dir, and we can't automatically say which filters need to be in the specified backend format and which should be in the default format. This needs further consideration. 2016-09-02T08:23:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Completely clean src/transcriptions/, and also clean tools/mt/apertium/filters/. 2016-09-01T13:31:23+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building alternate orthography fst's for dictionary and oahpa, and also morphers for alternative orthographies. Slight simplification of defs. 2016-08-24T13:18:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] One small change to support spellers for alternative orthographies built off of the raw fst instead of the standard fst. 2016-08-23T22:10:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a possibility to build fst's for alternate orthographies based on the raw fst surface forms, instead of from the default/standard orthography. 2016-08-23T20:40:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed all references to $(GIELLA_SHARED)/common into $(GIELLA_SHARED)/all_langs. 2016-08-23T06:28:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the code for identifying the location of GIELLA_CORE (former GTCORE). The code should be more robust, and is prepared to check against a pkg-config pc file as well. GTCORE is still used throughout the code, but in parallel to GIELLA_CORE, so that one can easily replace the former with the latter without causing bugs or other problems. 2016-08-22T20:20:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added checking for and setting of GIELLA_TEMPLATES, but only if you have defined GIELLA_MAINTAINER (renamed from GTMAINTAINER). Otherwise it is ignored. 2016-08-22T14:59:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Revert experiment with priority union - it doesn't work as expected when weights are involved. Corrected filenames in the .SECONDARY target. 2016-08-19T12:29:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added download links to the build feedbad for 'make upload' in tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/desktop/hfst/. 2016-08-19T10:31:43+00:00
> Replaced ref to $GTCORE/giella-shared with $GIELLA_SHARED. 2016-08-18T12:27:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Final step to make the GIELLA_SHARED dir be found in all cases: assign the path from pkg-config to the variable. 2016-08-18T10:36:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the separate test for content, instead adding the test to each possible location, moving to the next location if no data is found. 2016-08-18T09:45:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the search order for GIELLA_SHARED data: * using --with-giella-shared=/path/to/giella-shared/data/root/dir * env. variable GIELLA_SHARED * env. variable GIELLA_HOME * env. variable GTHOME * env. variable GTCORE * using pkg-config This way it is always possible to overtide everything else using the --with option. Added comments. 2016-08-18T08:59:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure test to check that there is actually data in GIELLA_SHARED. 2016-08-18T08:04:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] The giella-shared data dir is now found using several techniques in the following order: * evn. variable GIELLA_SHARED * evn. variable GIELLA_HOME * evn. variable GTHOME * evn. variable GTCORE * using --with-giella-shared=/dir/to/giella-shared * using pkg-config If all these fail, configure errors out. Since it a.o. uses GTHOME, the change should be of no concern to existing users having checked out everything. And since the svn location is still within GTCORE, it will also work for those checking out only the core and a single or a couple of languages without any action on their part. 2016-08-17T12:59:49+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Second steps in renaming and splitting the gtcore into giella-core, giella-shared and giella-templates: replaced $(GTCORE)/giella-shared with the Automake variable @GIELLA_SHARED@. 2016-08-15T12:38:11+00:00

1311a2316
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed '+' in front of tag patterns to be extracted from the tag list and used as input to regex generation scripts. This was done to accomodate the use of prefix tags, where the '+' is at the end of the tag, not in the beginning. 2016-06-09T23:00:26+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] The next batch of changes to support building hfst fst's with a specified backend fst format: desktop spellers are now supported. The speller fst's will be built using the specified backend format up to the point where corpus and tag weights are added, when the fst format will be changed to the default (openfst-tropical) format. That is, even if you specify (the unweighted) sfst as the backend format, the final speller will still be weighted. 2016-06-06T10:11:49+00:00

1325a2346
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for doing more targeted regex replacements on multichar sequences in parallel to the regular editdist operations. The idea is that these replacements can be applied more times (since they are few), and thus allow for more corrections of frequent spelling errors. 2016-05-18T06:37:22+00:00
1326a2348,2349
> Added language code. 2016-05-14T21:03:33+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new spellrelax system that will add an +Err/ tag (or more) to the analysis of words misspelled according to the new spellrelax rules. Can be very costly in terms of size if applied to large lexical fst's, and if many error types are tagged, so initially it is only applied to the transcriptor fst (which are used in Oahpa). Template data is from Plains Cree (crk). 2016-05-11T04:21:38+00:00

1336a2369
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for hfst-based tokenisers, built on generalisations of Kevin's work. They are built using the hfst-tool hfst-pmatch2fst, which is the Hfst implementation of the pmatch tool from Xerox.

1340a2377
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying backend fst format also for (parts of the) apertium fst's. One step further to speed up compilation by specifying e.g. sfst as the backend format. The implementation is a bit hacky, but will have to do for now. 2016-04-29T15:28:32+00:00
1341a2379
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building glossing analysers, where the analysis tags are NOT shifted around to canonical positions. The idea is that one keeps tags and morphs together in the lexc code, and that the analyser output thus will reflect the order of the surface morphs. If one wants to build such analysers, one has to specify the final analyser filename in src/Makefile.am. 2016-04-29T13:46:45+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Now also Oahpa transducers are ready to be built with a specified backend format when building using hfst. Also cleaned up the code, removed 300+ lines of code, and added support for builds using Foma. 2016-04-21T10:09:40+00:00
1345a2387,2388
> [Template merge - langs/und] A number of corrections to the previous commit for issues missed during the first round of testing. Now specifying an alternative backend format works correctly for all standard analysers and generators except for Oahpa-fst's. 2016-04-21T07:00:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled the new option to specify transducer format when compiling with Hfst, to speed up compilation time by using an unweighted format (ie sfst or foma). Default is still openfst-tropical, until further testing is done. 2016-04-21T05:39:13+00:00
1347a2391
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further preparations for enabling the new option to choose the backend format for fst's, for compilation speed improvements in cases where weight is not used: generalisations and corrections of build instructions. 2016-04-20T13:59:10+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated required versions for Hfst and VislCG3. A number of bug fixes and new features require these versions for many of our tools. 2016-03-17T07:25:36+00:00
1354a2421
> [Template merge - langs/und] One pattern rule had for some reason become ambiguous, and caused strange build behavior. Replaced with full filename in one stable case solved the issue. 2016-03-10T23:21:16+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Code cleanup - moved target variables related to running xfst tools to the xfscript include file, and thereby removing duplicate code. 2016-03-07T08:28:08+00:00
1357a2427,2428
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to enable building tokenisers, off by default. 2016-03-04T09:37:44+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to rename the Area variable in the previous commit. 2016-02-26T16:02:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First iteration of adding support for Area codes (ie countries) based on ISO 3166 codes. Right now does nothing except filtering out the tags, proper support coming in steps. Requires new version of the GTCORE scripts. 2016-02-26T15:51:15+00:00
1361a2435
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of hfst/xfst/foma for the top-level speller dir - invert when needed. 2016-02-24T13:44:55+00:00
1362a2437,2438
> [Template merge - langs/und] There was still one more automake file with references to the remove-derivation-position-tags.regex filter. Now they are gone. 2016-02-24T10:47:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] A typo made reversed compose&intersect seem buggy, whereas in fact it was not. 2016-02-23T14:43:02+00:00
1364a2441
> [Template merge - langs/und] Small correction to bring the Giella version of reversed comp&intersect closer to what Miikka has: added minimisation to the reversed twolc rules. 2016-02-23T12:25:04+00:00
1365a2443,2444
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to reverse the lexicon and the morph-phon rules during composition and intersection. Reduced the time needed for that operation to ≈1/3 of what it used to be in SMS, and RAM consumption went down from 11Gb to max 400Mb! Speed and RAM gains will vary from language to language. 2016-02-22T12:18:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now the lexical fst is first compiled into a .tmp file, to allow language-specific changes to be applied from .tmp to final file. More support for xfscript compilation. 2016-02-22T08:30:00+00:00
1367a2447
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added include to xfscfript-include.am, to let xfscripts be used in lexc compilation. 2016-02-21T09:07:14+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added analyser-disamb-gt-desc.hfst as a noinst_DATA target, to force make to build it instead of going directly to the *.hfstol file, and thus breaking compilation when local modifications are needed. 2016-02-19T07:21:07+00:00
1372a2457,2458
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added INVERT_<FSTTECH> variables to help in improving compilation of analysers and generators for different fst technologies (Xerox, Hfst, Foma). Hfst has the inversed convention for lookup compared to the other two, and by using a variable we can now actually share the same build code irrespective of which one we need to inverse for the final analyser or generator. 2016-02-18T13:24:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the remove-derivation-position-tags filter from language-independent processing, it is language-specific, and will be added to the languages needing it. This also makes it possible to do further local processing dependent on these tags. 2016-02-18T09:56:05+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] LibreOffice-voikko 5.0 support for spellers with alternating writing systems. 2016-02-05T01:00:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building zhfst files for mobile phone keyboards. This version is essentially the same as the desktop one, we'll start from here and adapt as we find better solutions. The zhfst file is compressed using xz for optimal file size (this is presently in violation of the zhfst specification, it must be updated soon). Also changed some of the configure options to error out when requested but without the required software installed - this is better than silently turning the requested feature off. 2016-02-04T12:15:18+00:00
1377a2467,2468

1382a2477,2478
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated path to desktop speller files. 2016-02-02T11:00:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to support building zhfst files for mobile systems (aka keyboard + speller). These need very different weighting priorities, another error model, and are thus placed in a separate subdirectory from desktop spellers. 2016-02-02T09:59:17+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] First step in adding support for mobile phone spellers. 2016-01-31T22:50:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building LO-voikko 5.0 extensions. Python-based interface to LO, and initial support for specifying unknown speller languages by typing in the language code in the language name field. 2016-01-30T08:09:43+00:00
1386a2485,2486
> [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out xz compression, it isn't supported by libvoikko. 2016-01-25T08:05:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed test pair conventions for twolc from !€/!$ to !!€/!!$ to make it follow the conventions in the rest of the infrastructure, and make it possible to include test data in the documentation. 2016-01-13T08:32:42+00:00
1388a2489
> [Template merge - langs/und] Readded the initial-letter edits in the regex - everything else is there for the initial letter machinery, so leaving it out made the build inconsistent. The default is off, with a large warning for those turning it on. 2015-12-08T16:11:06+00:00
1389a2491,2492
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added script to run suggestion testing for the hfst-ospell-service (MS Office) speller. Rewrote the speller testing scripts to allow parallel execution. 2015-12-08T14:08:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make transitivity tags optional also for the Apertium generator. 2015-12-02T14:06:32+00:00
1391a2495
> [Template merge - langs/und] Push weights even when not minimising the speller acceptor. Minimisation is not always the best strategy. 2015-12-01T13:28:29+00:00
1392a2497,2498
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed --Werror from the language-independent automake file. Added a variable to make it possible to add it to the language-specific automake file. 2015-11-27T14:58:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to enable symbol alignment during lexc compilation for the lexical transducer. Defaults to off for now, we need to test the effect on various languages before making it default to on. Also added --Werror to lexc to make it break on all warnings when compiling the lexical fst. 2015-11-27T12:58:57+00:00
1394a2501
> [Template merge - langs/und] Use tar + xz for a 40-50 % reduction in file size for zhfst files. 2015-11-27T09:16:01+00:00
1395a2503,2504
> [Template merge - langs/und] Allow longer filenames by using tar-pax for make dist. 2015-11-26T09:53:34+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added upload target for zhfst files. That will be the only method for spell checking in more than one language for now (for regular users). Not ideal, but have no time for anything else. 2015-11-25T13:00:05+00:00
1397a2507,2508

1405a2523,2524
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new variable HAS_FOMA, which will be set independently of the configuration if foma is available. This can be used to circumvent bugs in Hfst if weights are not needed: if foma is available, print as ATT, read in foma, perform transformations, print as ATT, convert, and continue. 2015-11-10T10:16:32+00:00

1412a2537,2538
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter to remove tags irrelevant to speller builds. Adjusted required version of GTCORE accordingly. 2015-10-19T07:33:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a bug with filter compilations for speller filters involving tag conversion to flag diacritics. 2015-10-15T10:13:51+00:00
1414a2541
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst is always built, to ensure we have the necessary prerequisites for all targets. Refactored the initial speller fst build to use common build code for all fst technologies. Makes it possible to easier test and compare test results when debugging. 2015-10-14T12:45:27+00:00
1415a2543,2544
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the response to missing transducers from FAIL to SKIP to avoid problems with lexc tests for fst's not enabled and thus not available. Instead report the missing fst to the user. 2015-10-05T10:23:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Streamlined descriptive compounding tags to follow a shared tag structure. 2015-10-03T09:22:13+00:00

1420a2553
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a comment about the non-functioning of the initial edit setting. Made the compound-restricted fst a tmp file, to allow for additional local processing. 2015-09-29T08:10:20+00:00
1421a2555,2556
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed all minimization of the error model except for the final build step. Removed also the initial letter handling for now, it blows up the error model, and slows it down correspondingly, making spellers that has turned this on useless. For now we apply the regular error model on the first letter, that seems to work ok. 2015-09-28T17:49:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a very short test script written by Lene to help run a subset of tests frequently needed. 2015-09-25T10:44:58+00:00
1423a2559,2560
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a problem running bc on the linux servers, which caused the yaml test summaries to be blank. Fixes bug #2054. 2015-09-24T13:43:03+00:00
> Replaced gtdshared with giella-shared in all remaining places. The old name does not work for a gtcore installation on a server - only the new name is installed. 2015-09-24T12:53:32+00:00
1425a2563,2564
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to specify how many lines of the frequency corpus to be used in the frequency weighting, to trim the acceptor fst at a point where the weights don't really matter. 2015-09-23T10:36:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced 'giellatekno' with 'giella' or added Divvun, depending on context. 2015-09-18T14:54:04+00:00
1427a2567
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed m4/giellatekno.m4 to bring it in line with the switch to 'giella' for all things common to GT and Divvun. 2015-09-18T10:20:35+00:00
1428a2569,2570

1432a2577,2578
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust handling of MWE in speller testing. Now also possible to specify build dir different from source dir. 2015-09-16T08:12:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a Makefile.am variable to turn on or off corpus-based (frequency) weighting of suggestions. Default for the time being is off while we work out the best interactions between the different parts of the spellers. Changed one intermediary filename to ensure proper dependency checks and thus rebuilds. 2015-09-16T06:54:07+00:00
1434a2581
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying regexes or list of string pairs for initial and final symbols in the error model. Also added a Makefile variable to control whether to allow edits of the initial letter(s), default is ‘no’. 2015-09-15T13:06:41+00:00
1435a2583,2584

1437a2587,2588
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made new of a new option for the speller suggestion testing: output an attribute on each test word element containing essential info about the correct suggestion. This will support better styling of the xml file with the test data. Also changed the path to the css from the local filesystem (which will vary from machine to machine) to the svn repository web url. 2015-09-07T12:58:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to hold source files to be included in the distro but not compiled as such. 2015-09-03T10:30:25+00:00
1439a2591,2592
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added first version of a shell script to check the suggestions generated by spellers. Requires the file test/data/typos.txt for data input. 2015-09-02T19:41:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Shortened a filename to make tar happy when building distribution packages. 2015-09-02T12:28:21+00:00
1441a2595
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed an error in distcheck - one test shell script was not included. 2015-09-02T08:59:08+00:00
1442a2597,2598
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made one step in the speller build behave properly wrt silent builds. Removed grammar checker targets, we are far from ready for this, and it breaks 'make distcheck'. 2015-09-02T06:55:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to pass a compilation option to hfst-regexp2fst. Used this variable to compile all filter regexes with the option --xerox-composition=ON. This will ensure that all filters where flag diacritics are used as symbols will be compiled correctly for proper used in later compositions. A.o. this fixes a bug where tags converted to flags to restrict compounding did not work at all. 2015-09-01T14:30:21+00:00
1444a2601
> Renamed files to bring them in line with the naming conventions in the new infra. 2015-08-18T10:52:58+00:00
1445a2603,2604
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced sed expression with double cut - the sed did not work on the xserve for whatever reason, and caused the testing to hang. 2015-08-17T09:54:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust checking of Saxon, now requires that any jar found is at least v8.0. 2015-08-17T08:05:07+00:00
1447a2607
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added /usr/share/java/ as a search path for the Saxon jar, this is what is used on the UiT Linux virtual machines, and probably many other Linux systems. 2015-08-14T06:50:24+00:00
1448a2609,2610
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building Mozvoikko spellers for our languages. 2015-08-13T08:05:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Adding support for specifying one-sided tests (half tests) in the lexc test data, using an optional .gen or .ana "suffix" after the fst name. Simplified source file processing. 2015-08-06T11:42:25+00:00
1450a2613,2614
> Removed punctuation file merged in from the template in cases where a punctuation file already existed under a different name. 2015-06-15T05:43:49+00:00

1452a2617,2618
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added lexicon filtering when pair-testing twolc rules. 2015-06-11T14:05:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected e-mail address, changed the template content of the transcription files from SMA to CRK, and at the same time corrected the direction of the code. Also added a default punctuation lexicon. 2015-06-09T21:29:05+00:00
1454a2621
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for easter eggs specific to alternative writing systems and other variants. Will help in debugging. 2015-06-07T19:44:39+00:00
1455a2623,2624
> Replaced Latin a-z with more relevant alphabets. Not all of the langauges have the appropriate alphabets, so when doing error model development this file should be proofread. Small letters: all in normal orthography. Capital letters: The ones thay may occur word-initially. These are the letters we may suggest. 2015-06-05T01:34:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved specification of default weight and editing distance to the language specific Makefile. 2015-06-05T01:33:41+00:00
1457a2627
> [Template merge - langs/und] After a lot of experimenting, a moderate set of changes to the speller error models. The biggest change is that the alphabet for the edit distance error model is not taken from the acceptor anymore, but must be explicitly listed in the editdist.*.txt file. The suggestion speed is back to normal, but more work is needed re the interaction of the error model and corpus weights. 2015-06-05T00:48:06+00:00
1458a2629,2630
> [Template merge - langs/und] Prefixed all silent build strings for Hfst tools with H, for easier identification. 2015-06-04T09:46:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out the old target for calculating unit weights (default weight for out-of-corpus word forms), and added a new which is basically the highest tropical weight + the ALPHA smoothing value. This is just the first step in further developing the suggestion ordering for the spellers. 2015-05-27T14:47:23+00:00
1460a2633
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a simple test to check a minimum suggestion speed for our test word nuvviDspeller. No speller should be released that does not pass this test. Additional and more elaborate tests should be added as well, this is just the very bare minimum in suggestion speed testing. 2015-05-25T13:56:47+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed downcasing of derived short names. Made yaml testing output a bit more readable (hopefully). 2015-05-21T07:49:26+00:00
1467a2647
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust xfscript build code for hfst-xfst. Clean hfstol files. 2015-05-18T10:16:06+00:00
1468a2649,2650
> [Template merge - langs/und] Extended Foma support to alternate writing systems and orthographies. At the same time put to use a new idiom to handle multiple independent target variables / patterns, which will be useful in other contexts as well. The code was generalised using this new idiom, and effectively reduced to half the original code size, with much less duplicate code. 2015-05-15T08:52:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First working version of foma builds. The basic set of analysers and generators are built, but nothing else. A lot of changes to variables and build rules, including generalisations that save quite a few lines of code. 2015-05-11T15:38:16+00:00
1470a2653
> [Template merge - langs/und] First steps to support building with Foma. Lexicon compilation is working, but note that Foma crashes on regexes in lexc. 2015-05-08T15:00:46+00:00

1473a2659
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a build bug for MacVoikko, causing the final target to always be out of date. Regulated verbosity for zhfst targets. The twolc testing scripts now print a message when there is no test data. The Hfst twolc testing script properly detects when there is no test data, and exits with the SKIP (77) value. 2015-04-27T08:55:09+00:00

1476a2665,2666
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further modularisation and improvements to weighted spellers. With hfst3 revision 4329, using a tab-separated tag reweighting file is working. 2015-04-21T11:29:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove usage tags when building spellers, speller tags were throwned out. 2015-04-16T09:45:40+00:00
1478a2669,2670
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an attempt at normalising the corpus-based weights towards a standard max upper weight, to allow a much higher weight for strings not to be suggested. Also split the processing of adding corpus-based weights and morphology weights into more steps - retaining each intermediate fst - to allow easier debugging of the weight assignments. 2015-04-16T08:15:08+00:00

1487a2687
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for corpus-based (frequency) weighting of the speller fst's. Also reorganised where to specify the tag-based weights (and this is subject to change pending a bug fix in hfst-reweight). All languages are given a toy corpus, which can be replaced with a real one. This is finally the core of Tommi's dissertation applied to all languages. 2015-04-09T09:26:35+00:00
1488a2689,2690

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed multichar definition of superfluous flag diacritics. 2015-03-13T13:47:40+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new directory named devtools/ to each language, with the idea that it should contain tools useful for development, but not necessarily suitable for automake testing. Initially it contains shell scripts to generate a table of generated word forms for each continuation lexicon. 2015-03-13T10:24:25+00:00
1500a2713
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed corpus names from tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/hfst/data/Makefile.am. It caused the build to stop with an error for all languages except FIN. 2015-03-12T08:44:38+00:00

1505a2723,2724
> Added real language name, some formatting changes. 2015-03-10T14:38:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for all languages to generate the abbr.txt file used by $GTCORE/scripts/preprocess. At the same time added initial support for compiling pmatch scripts into fst's for hfst-proc2, which is the future alternative to preprocess. 2015-03-09T14:52:03+00:00
1507a2727
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to remove some debug statements from the yaml test runner. Now cleaned. 2015-03-06T16:21:47+00:00
1508a2729,2730
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved MWE tag processing into the core - we want this for many languages. 2015-03-06T15:24:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for a new type of yaml tests: speller acceptance testing. The basic idea is to just give a list of words and word constructions (compounds, derivations, etc) the speller should accept or reject, and let the yaml test bench verify whether this is actually the case. 2015-03-06T13:07:55+00:00
1510a2733
> [Template merge - langs/und] Several changes to properly support all position-based +CmpN/XX tags: * moved tag path splitting and tag-to-flag conversion into separate regex files in the core. * added support for compiling and using the new regexes * added support for a new type +CmpN/Suff * added the required multichar symbols to the root.lexc files * increased required core version number 2015-03-05T15:13:56+00:00
1511a2735,2736
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the yaml test bench when both hfst and xfst was enabled, but where only one type is built, e.g. for Apertium. 2015-03-05T14:08:15+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added build support for alternate orthographies: default fst's, dicts and oapha. 2015-03-04T15:22:16+00:00
1513a2739
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the wrong fst to be picked in certain cases, which caused the test script to fail. 2015-03-04T10:51:23+00:00
1514a2741,2742
> [Template merge - langs/und] A couple of changes related to testing: * require Python 3.3+ * require new gtcore * update YAML test runner to make SMS testing work as intended also with Xerox 2015-03-03T16:31:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for country/region specific proofing tools in configure.ac. 2015-03-02T12:50:54+00:00
1516a2745,2746
> [Template merge - langs/und] We do not support anything but the latest/newest Voikko now. 2015-02-27T12:40:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finalised the basic multiple writing system support, by adding support for Oahpa and dictionary fst's. 2015-02-27T11:12:23+00:00
1518a2749,2750
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configuration flag to enable two-step compose-intersect. In most cases this will not make any difference, but for some languages it will correct a bug in compose-intersect that would otherwise create a bad fst, and for other languages it will make the operation much slower without changing the fst. Disabled by default, whether it is useful must be tested in each case / language. 2015-02-27T09:11:18+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] +CmpN/Only supported, first steps in tag splitting taken. 2015-01-26T20:43:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved code common to all yaml testrunner shell scripts to an include file in GTCORE to avoid code duplication and reduce the risk for introducing bugs. This requires the newest version of the CORE. Because of the inclusion, I had to rename the test runner to .sh.in, and added autoconf processing of it. Also added a test file for testing the base speller fst (it must be tailored to each language of course). 2015-01-26T13:52:29+00:00
1563a2839
> [Template merge - langs/und] Last change to get hyperminimisation to produce the correct output: made the derived-proper downcase script being processed by autoconf, so that we can require a symbol in a certain context, and at the same time in the end let the symbol be empty if not needed. 2015-01-22T10:38:50+00:00
1564a2841,2842
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added optional flag diacritic inserted by Hfst hyperminimisation. This resolves the remaining cases of errors after the hfst team fixed a bug in lexc compilation with hyperminimisation turned on. Since it is optional, it does not make any harm when using Xerox or when not using hyperminimisation. 2015-01-22T08:36:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added xerox variable flag-is-epsilon to the tag reorder regex. This fixes most of the cases of errors after the hyperminimisation bug was fixed in hfst-lexc. The remaining errors must be fixed in the downcase-derived-proper regex. 2015-01-22T07:15:43+00:00
1566a2845
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added more silent builds for hfst tools. 2015-01-20T19:52:00+00:00
1567a2847,2848
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added conversion of tags to flag diacritica for position-restricting tags. These are currently used in sma, sme, smj and sje. Together with some additions to the R lexicon, the tags will finally do what they are meant to do for hfst-based spellers. 2015-01-20T09:03:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Multichar symbol definitions for flag diacritica controlling compounding based on position tags. Done for most langs, the symbols will be ignored if not used. 2015-01-19T12:05:06+00:00
1569a2851,2852

> [Template merge - und] Corrected names of compiled twolc files in test/src/phonology/pair-test*.sh.in. We need to use the 'compose' fst because compiled twolc files are not treated the same as other fst's. We can't just skip the new lookup-friendly filenames either, because morphophonological rules can be written using xfscript, in which case the lookup renaming (and inversion) is essential. 2014-10-27T14:00:29+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Now both general and language-pair specific relabelling using regexes are supported, in addition to using relabel files. The regexes allow context-dependent and multisymbol changes, whereas the relabel files only cover 1:1 mappings of single symbols. The actual change was to add support for regex files in the language-pair independent processing. The tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/README.txt file was more or less completely rewritten to better document the filenames being recognised, and how they should be used. 2014-10-23T06:03:36+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Several changes to accomodate a downcaseerror variant of the L2 error fst for Oahpa: * added configure.ac option --enable-downcaseerror (independent of the L2 opt) * a number of changes to the build instructions for Oahpa to support the new fst * made the error fst compilation independent of whether an L2 twolc/xfscript file is used - if not, it will just use the ordinary twolc/xfscript file. This way it is possible to build a downcaseerror fst without starting L2 development. * svn-copied regexes from the old to the new infra, including to the core * increased gtcore version number and required version number due to new regexes 2014-10-02T14:10:42+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Tagset relabeling didn't work for xfst files, now it does. Also generalised the use of relabel files (for use with hfst-relabel). 2014-10-02T06:18:41+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of hfst's with alternative tagsets, now that the *.hfst files are not in optimised lookup format. Silenced regex compilation. 2014-10-01T14:38:45+00:00
1616a2945
> [Template merge - und] Last part of the lookup & composition cleanup: phonetics and phonology now covered. Now all non-lexical and non-filter files have a suffix .compose.* or .lookup.* depending on their intended use, and they are all properly inverted where needed (i.e. only for Xerox' lookup tool). There might still be source files to clean, but that is a separate step. 2014-09-30T22:43:32+00:00
1617a2947,2948
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a couple of cases where old filenames were still used, and thus broke compilation. Also improved filtering of transcriptors, and constructed transcriptor target names dynamically based on the source files. 2014-09-30T21:22:42+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Xfscript and lookup cleanup: now we explicitly build files made for lookup and composition marked in the filenames. This is done for hyphenation and for orthography, phonology and phonetics still to be done. From now on there should be no need to use invert as part of the xfscript code - DON'T DO IT! All targets updated to use the new filenames. Removed inversion from the hyphenation xfscript. 2014-09-30T19:35:01+00:00

Now all hfst transducers in optimised lookup format have the suffix .hfstol, and optimisation should not be hidden or implisit anymore. All test scripts should be updated as well. Also move all common targets from src/Makefile.am to am-shared/src-dir-include.am and sub-included AM files. This cleans up the src/ dir Makefile.am quite a lot. 2014-09-29T15:59:02+00:00

Now only local / language specific regex source files need to be listed in the local Makefile.am. * Fixed a problem with MT filter compilation that only revealed itself in sme. * Another filter build cleanup: all filter regexes in core are now built for all languages. One obsolete filter was removed. 2014-09-18T17:05:45+00:00
1635a2983,2984

> [Template merge - und] The first major step for adding support for generating list-based spellers such as Hunspell and the PLX (Polderland/MS Word) spellers. The conversion is not trivial, since we try to control compounding according to the linguistic specifiation in the lexicon (using tags). Although PLX is only for three Sámi languages, Hunspell conversion should be useful for all languages in our infrastructure. No real Hunspell or PLX files produced yet, only prerequisite fst's. - At the same time fixed a glitch in the version checking of VislCG3 that would turn off support for CG files now that the vislcg3 svn revision number has turned 10 000. 2014-09-08T20:31:14+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Generalised and simplified the code for building oxt's - no more hard-coded filenames. Now the LO-voikko versions supported as well as the platforms are just defined in two variables, and the rest follows from there. The build code also handles cases of unsupported combinations of voikko versions and platforms. Also silenced the build quite a lot in non-verbose mode. 2014-09-04T07:58:01+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Made the hfst optimised lookup file format explicit by using the .hfstol suffix, and by optimising files for lookup in a separate build step, instead of implicitly as before. So far only for tools/mt/apertium/, but more will come. Removed the removal of semantic tags - they are already optional, which should be more flexible and robust. 2014-08-27T11:52:53+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Added --encode-weights to determinise and minimise. This fixed the never-ending compilation of Finnish spellers. 2014-08-25T14:16:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] The optimisations that worked for Greenlandic didn't work for Finnish, potentially due to Finnish being corpus-weighted and thus posing more challenges to determinisation and minimisation. Because of this the Greenlandic optimisation is now rolled into the configuration option --enable-minimised-spellers, OFF by default. 2014-08-22T17:31:28+00:00
1655a3023
> [Template merge - und] Added size and speed optimisations to the speller compilation process: remove-epsilons, push-weights, determinise and minimise. Together this made the KAL speller *much* smaller and *much* faster. It is now as fast and small as any other fst-based speller. 2014-08-22T09:09:54+00:00
1656a3025,3026
> [Template merge - und] Hyperminimisation seems to be stable now, and I have added it as a standard configuration option. Also added autoconf support for the preliminary tool hfst-proc2, to facilitate easier testing of the tokeniser/analyser. 2014-08-21T08:45:06+00:00

1682a3077,3078
> [Template merge - und] Removed temporarily the downcasing of derived proper nouns from the hfst transducers - it causes them to become malfunctioning. 2014-06-11T11:54:50+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed bug introduced yesterday that broke compilation of certain xfscript files. 2014-06-10T15:57:20+00:00
1684a3081
> [Template merge - und] Added support for testing the fst for initial upper casing of strings. This also includes yaml test support for non-analysing/-genereting fst's. 2014-06-09T18:14:55+00:00
1685a3083,3084
> [Template merge - und] Properly handle downcasing of derived proper nouns as well as optional initial upper case. The optional initial upper-casing doesn't work for derived proper nouns when using Hfst because of an unimplemented featuare in hfst-xfst. It is reported to the hfst team. Increased gtd core version number due to new scripts and possible dependencies in the gtd core. 2014-06-06T11:19:13+00:00
> Use/Sub to Err/Sub Command used: cd $GTHOME perl -p -i -e 's/Use\/Sub/Err\/Sub/g' `grep -rl 'Use/Sub' * 2> /dev/null` 2014-06-04T08:13:54+00:00
1687a3087,3088
> [Template merge - und] Extracting flag diacritics, to build regexes that can ignore them in certain cases (like optional initial upper case). Requires new version of the gtd core. At the same time split tag extraction in two - the first step extracts the whole sigma set, and from that we can extract tags, flag diacritics, etc. The sigma set extraction was greatly improved, removing a number of small errors due to handling of reserved symbols in Hfst and Xfst. 2014-05-26T07:42:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added test summary for all yaml tests for a given fst. 2014-05-19T06:37:44+00:00
1689a3091,3092
> [Template merge - und] With feedback from Brendan I finally got the number of tests passed and failed printed as part of the YAML testing. 2014-05-16T00:55:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Adaption to a new version of the morph-tester.py script by Brendan Molloy. Small adjustments to the yaml test printouts. 2014-05-15T21:40:20+00:00
1691a3095
> [Template merge - und] Major bug fix to the generate lemma test script. Now it actually checks that the generated lemmas correspond to the listed ones. Several of the languages had local modifications. Those are brought forward to the new version, to my best effort. 2014-05-12T20:18:44+00:00
1692a3097,3098
> [Templage merge - und] Bugfix: no hardcoded language codes. 2014-05-12T11:25:23+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Now also (language pair independent) morphological generators for Apertium are installed with their correct Apertium file names. 2014-05-12T10:56:35+00:00
1694a3101,3102
> [Template merge - und] Added renaming to Apertium style filenames, changed installation file list to only include files actually used by Apertium. With this change, everything should be in place for a fully automatic integration between the GT-Divvun infrastructure and the Apertium infrastructure through the use of pkg-config files, with one exception: morphological generators. 2014-05-12T07:19:57+00:00
> [Template merge - und] A rewritten pc file, with proper paths actually reflecting where things are installed, and with a shortened description to better fit the use of it. 2014-05-09T11:01:21+00:00
1696a3105,3106
> [Template merge - und] We also need to install the pkg-config file... 2014-05-09T10:25:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] After a long discussion, the moniker 'giella' was chosen instead of gtdivvun. Changed datadir from $(datadir)/gtdivvun/* to $(datadir)/giella/*. Added a pkg-config file so that all installed resources can be found automatically. 2014-05-09T10:03:49+00:00
1698a3109
> [Template merge - und] Changed datadir from $(datadir)/hfst/* to $(datadir)/gtdivvun/*, as it is the directory used to install the gtdivvun products, and not only hfst transducers are installed. 2014-05-08T08:13:33+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Require Automake 1.11.6 to avoid errors caused by older Automake's. 2014-05-07T12:05:03+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Make semantic tags optional also for dict and oahpa generators. Added support for hfst fst's for dict and oahpa. 2014-04-29T07:08:58+00:00
1701a3115,3116
> [Template merge - und] Make semantic tags optional for all generators. Fixes bug http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1854. 2014-04-29T05:58:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Uncommented the cg3-with-apertium-tags targets, increased the gtcore version number. 2014-04-28T14:36:03+00:00
1703a3119,3120
> [Template merge - und] Started work on adding hyphenators. No substantial changes, just Automake conditionals. 2014-04-25T20:12:28+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Actually made the options --disable-analysers and --disable-generators do what they should, earlier they had no effect. Also renamed those options. Wrapped the filter targets in mt/tools/apertium/filters/ in apertium conditionals, so that they will only be built if the apertium option is enabled. Added separate configure.ac option to disable the transcriptors (the num2text family). 2014-04-25T11:34:46+00:00
1705a3123
> [Template merge - und] Make sure all tests are within conditionals - only run them if the fst's have been built. 2014-04-24T16:19:26+00:00
1706a3125,3126
> [Template merge - und] Added conversion of analysis tags from GTDivvun format to Apertium format for the vislcg3 files. The generated vislcg3 files are not valid, and the targets are thus commented out for now. 2014-04-23T07:53:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for tmp files in the apertium target language specific analysers, to allow local processing of those analysers. Added more comments to explain the build process. 2014-04-17T06:30:25+00:00
1708a3129
> [Template update - und] Rewrote tag reordering of semantic tags to use a dynamically generated regex, and split tag reordering in three: reordering sub-POS tags, semantic tags, and language specific tags. The two first reordering operations are done on all languages. The reordering is done when building the raw file, to build a fixed tag order that other fst operations can rely on. The raw file build had to be split in two steps because of this. 2014-04-16T10:06:12+00:00
1709a3131,3132
> [Template merge - und] Added support for target-language specific filtering for the Apertium analysers. 2014-04-15T16:06:41+00:00
> [Template merge - und] A major update to the Apertium fst building: * corrected broken logic when building the list of tags used by a language * build filter to remove derivation strings dynamically from the list of tags * added a new taglist2remove...strings-regex.sh file to the core * added a new dir filters/ within tools/mt/apertium/ for building apertium specific filters * added facility to modify locally remove...strings.regex files by using an exception file * build the remove-derivation-strings.regex dynamically also for regular fst's 2014-04-15T13:19:37+00:00

> Corrected path to yaml testfiles. 2014-04-13T06:57:05+00:00
1712a3137,3138
> [Template merge - und] Now building the remove dialect tag filter dynamically, in the same way as done for the semantic tags. Requires a new version of the GTD core. 2014-04-11T09:48:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Dialect tags are now removed in the Apertium fst compilation. In addition, tags can now be custom changed and reordered on a language pair basis, see README.txt in tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. 2014-04-10T15:06:42+00:00
1714a3141,3142
> [Template merge - und] Corrected several errors in the MT Apertium fst builds: now removing semantic tags and tags for originating language. Silent hfst-invert. 2014-04-10T09:37:39+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Modified the gttags.txt target to produce output also in cases where no GTD tags are defined (this is the case in some of the experimental languages). Earlier the build would break in this case. 2014-04-10T07:37:13+00:00
1716a3145,3146
> Moved yaml files, two files with inflection codes. 2014-04-09T08:32:58+00:00

1719a3151,3152
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug with optional semantic tags: we built the regex, but not the fst's. 2014-04-08T11:09:21+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a bug in the lexc yaml testing. Fixed file refs in the dict fst tests. 2014-04-07T08:43:18+00:00
1721a3155
> [Template merge - und] Moved yaml test scripts for different transducer types up one level, to correspond to the parallel location of the fst files in the build tree. 2014-04-03T11:30:12+00:00
1722a3157,3158
> [Template merge - und] Generalised the yaml test runner code, to automatically identify the relative paths of the test scripts and the fst's being tested, so that all sorts of fst's can be tested irrespective of where they are built. Added yaml testing for MT/Apertium. 2014-04-03T09:55:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved some back-end scripts for yaml testing to the uppermost test directory, to ease sharing of the same code across test subdirectories. Updated paths to the new location. 2014-04-02T12:44:05+00:00
1724a3161
> [Template merge - und] Moved all silencing code to a separate include file (except in a few cases of double includes). Made the yaml testing a bit more verbose when rerunning individual tests (copy-paste testing). 2014-04-02T10:44:33+00:00
1725a3163,3164
> [Template merge - und] Changed target language specifc analysers to be based off of analyser-mt-gt-desc.hfst, instead of the *.tmp.hfst file, to allow local post processing to be applied in the step from *.tmp.hfst to the *.hfst file. 2014-04-02T06:44:53+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Forgot to remove all the targets and build instructions in the old location. 2014-04-01T15:43:08+00:00
1727a3167,3168
> [Template merge - und] Finalised moving the Apertium MT build code to the new location. All parts have been generalised, and the set of target languages to go with a specific source language (when analysing) is specified in configure.ac. That is, just list your target languages in configure.ac, and off you go. One feature still missing: target language derivation (and other) string filtering for the source language analyser. Coming soon. 2014-04-01T14:36:20+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Reorganised MT fst building, moving it to a new dir in tools/. This is done to avoid too much stuff in one dir (src/), and to make it easier to extend the MT support without making the build files too large for one dir. 2014-03-31T14:08:46+00:00
1729a3171,3172
> [Template merge - und] Added a tmp-file step for the raw fst, to allow local/language specific overrides when building the raw transducer. Required for Estionan. 2014-03-26T20:39:26+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for dialectal fst's in Oahpa. The dialect tags need only be specified in $GTLANG/configure.ac, and all filters and fst's will be constructed automatically. 2014-03-25T18:02:17+00:00
1731a3175
> [Template merge - und] Made generated regex files build and be retained, as well as deleted when using 'make clean'. 2014-03-24T21:42:07+00:00
1732a3177,3178
> [Template merge - und] Added missing test runners, and at the same time made the test XFAILS (i.e. expected fails due to immature code). This commit completes the dictionary compilation update. 2014-03-24T18:41:35+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Greatly improved support for the dictionary fst building: * filtering semantic tags now work properly (removed for all but Prop) * properly silent when using silent builds * added dict-specific yaml test files and corresponding test runners * removed building of reduntant dictionary fst's since we now can test   generation and analysis independently - we only test the fst's we   are actually going to use, in the intended "direction"; this should   noticably speed up compilation, especially when using hfst * all languages now build a dictionary analyser with a mobile phone   spell relax Also removed semantic tags from the regular analyser, as discussed earlier. Increased the required GTD core version, as the new version is required to fix the bug mentioned above. 2014-03-24T17:12:05+00:00
1734a3181
> [Template merge - und] Corrected the test that triggers a FAIL in the twolc negative test script. 2014-03-20T14:21:36+00:00
1735a3183,3184
> [Template merge - und] Temporarily add the new twolc pair tests to XFAIL-TESTS, to make them pass as expected fails. This will let all tests run, but will have to be reverted either when all broken twolc tests are fixed, or when the full test suite can be run without stopping make. 2014-03-20T07:17:22+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Rewrote the test for awk to check for a feature found only in GNU awk, and use the one found. Will check both awk and gawk, and use whichever supports the feature (gawk on some Linux systems is renamed awk). This should make the build configuration more robust. 2014-03-19T08:19:07+00:00
1737a3187
> [Template merge - und] Added twolc pair string testing for Xerox. Hfst requires another type of pair strings, and can't easily be tested at present. 2014-03-18T13:41:44+00:00
1738a3189,3190
> [Template merge - und] Added more tailored silent output, silenced Xerox tools as much as possible (not very much). 2014-03-17T13:17:58+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made documentation build process work properly when using VPATH builds, and at the same time silenced the doc build by default. 2014-03-17T09:33:10+00:00
1740a3193,3194
> [Template merge - und] Replaced grep in Makefile with a shell script for extracting semantic tags. This is done to catch the case where there are no semantic tags to extract. Earlier this caused a failed build, now it is handled properly. Required GTD core version increased because of the new script is only found in the latest version of the core. 2014-03-14T11:18:12+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Build remove-semantic-tags.regex for all languages, since we now use it when building speller files. 2014-03-14T10:04:25+00:00
1742a3197,3198
> [Template merge - und] Only test spellers if we build spellers. 2014-03-14T09:51:34+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a test to check zhfst file validity. Not functional yet, because of a bug in hfst-ospell. 2014-03-14T08:53:04+00:00
1744a3201
> [Template merge - und] Fixed bug http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1830. The word border mark removal had earlier been moved from a preceding step to the final product compilation step. It was added to the foma speller compilation, but not included in the hfst speller compilation for some reason. Now it is. 2014-03-13T10:10:27+00:00
1745a3203,3204
> [Template merge - und] r89769 : Fixed a build bug: it tried to build oxt files also when hfst support was not enabled. Now oxt files will only be built if hfst is on, and spellers have been requested. 2014-03-04T10:14:00+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a problem with building zhfst files using VPATH builds. 2014-02-28T15:34:23+00:00
1747a3207,3208
> [Template merge - und] Added convenience upload target to upload the oxt files and make a permanent link to the latest version. 2014-02-28T09:24:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of the hfst lexical transducer, and made it easy to use the -F option to hyperminimise the lexical fst. Using pattern rules instead of fixed filenames. 2014-02-27T22:50:36+00:00
1749a3211,3212
> [Template merge - und] Added first working build of oxt files. Not yet generalised, but working with the paths we have. Will build Windows and Mac OXT files for all languages. 2014-02-27T21:03:54+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Whitespace change. 2014-02-25T12:44:55+00:00
1751a3215
> [Template merge - und] Stop with error if --with-hfst was requested but could not be turned on. Based on patch by Unhammer. 2014-02-25T12:14:44+00:00
1752a3217,3218
> The t elements containing exactly one ..adjective.. ..wsp.. and the capital ..A.. have been changed t such that a pos attribute has been generated with the value ..A.. and the ..wsp A.. content has been removed from the text content. 2014-02-20T03:13:27+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Really fixed syntax errors, and another old error. 2014-02-13T22:56:54+00:00
1754a3221,3222
> [Template merge - und] Fixed syntax errors. 2014-02-13T22:44:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] More comments and clear separation between the different macro sections. Added first components for configuring oxt building - checking whether it is possible to sync the oxt template locally from $GTHOME. Added check that all components of the Xerox tools are installed before enabling Xerox builds. 2014-02-13T22:32:47+00:00
1756a3225,3226
> [Template merge - und] Added a variable to hold the LibreOffice version number where speller support for a language was initially available. 2014-02-13T18:19:21+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made minimisation of speller automatas configurable (default=no), since it can be extremely time and resource consuming for some languages, and the size difference for the final fst is not very big; we might loose some speed thoug, which needs to be tested. Reorganised the configure.ac coce by moving most code to the m4/giellatekno.m4 macro file. What remains in configure.ac is pretty clean and mostly easily understood. 2014-02-13T17:00:39+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Removed test-src-morph-include.am - it was in reality empty. 2014-02-12T15:37:23+00:00
> Moved word border removal to each fst-based speller, as we need it in the hfst speller production (for word-based weighting) but not in the foma-based speller. Rewrote all (fst-)speller build steps to regexes instead of hfst pipelines. 2014-02-12T13:14:35+00:00
1761a3235
> [Template update - und] Rewrote the mt build instructions to a regex instead of an hfst pipe. Functionality is the same, but 40 lines of code disappeared, and the new code is much easier to read. 2014-02-12T09:56:23+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Removed 130 lines of code, and made the code much more readable by replacing the long pipe of hfst commands with one regex pr target. The actual regex is a mirror copy of the xfst regex already in the file, which means that it is also very easy to maintain functional parity between the two architectures. 2014-02-11T13:45:32+00:00

This symbol mismatch is fatal for hfst-ospell, and caused all non-latin spellers to crash (the latin spellers would all have this symbol ('p') anyway, so no problem was noticed earlier). 2014-01-19T16:23:55+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Moved xfscript compilation out of phonetics-include and hyphenation include. These am-files contained and invert command that combined with an invert command in the actual xfscripts created a meaningless double inversion. 2014-01-13T14:40:29+00:00
> Removed all instances of 'invert net' in xfscript files. In reality it was a double inversion in almost all cases: first inversion within the xfscript, followed by an inversion in the command given to xfst. This double inversion made it impossible to unify otherwise identical operations for the same set of files, and would generally cause confusion as to what was going on. 2014-01-13T14:13:56+00:00

1835a3383,3384

The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give a warning).

> Added support for making variant analysers and generators using the Apertium tag convensions. The generated transducers are still not fully Apertium-compatible but they are a major step forward. Template update. 2013-06-12T13:44:33+00:00
> Renamed analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst to generator-raw-gt-desc.hfst, to make the behavior in hfst-lookup explicit and clear. Still, the "generator" behaves as the Xerox "analyser" in hfst when in comes to composition and filtering. Confusing, I know. Template update. 2013-06-11T09:48:17+00:00
1903a3519

1906a3525,3526
> Added an explicit copy operation into the hfst speller dir, to facilitate local modifications of the speller transducer before further processing, by just replacing the copy operation with whatever is needed. Template update. 2013-06-07T00:03:18+00:00
> Added string pairs and whole-word corrections to the speller error model. Added support for an ocr error model. Removed obsolete Voikko config file. Corrected bugs in the hfst M4 macros. Template update. 2013-06-06T23:22:21+00:00
1908a3529,3530

> converted 2013-05-24T09:57:15+00:00
1911a3535,3536

1915a3543,3544
> Splitted and renamed the remove-morph-border filter. Rewrote a number of targets to reflect this. There are now three filters instead of one, to allow for more flexible fst building for speech processing. 2013-04-26T12:49:21+00:00
> Added gzip compression of foma speller transducer, and proper checks for prerequisites. Foma spellers can now be disabled, they are enabled by default. Template update. 2013-04-24T11:21:36+00:00
1917a3547
> Corrected a bug when building foma-based spellers. Changed one fst filename to follow the naming scheme for the new infra. Improved building of the zfst speller file. 2013-04-24T07:02:32+00:00
1918a3549,3550
> Pronouns is now valid xml. The other documents have been validated to a greater extent against their xsd. 2013-04-24T06:25:45+00:00

1934a3581,3582
> Updated the zhfst building to reflect recent changes in Voikko. There is now official support for zhfst speller files, but with a new location and no *.pro file. Also added simple support for local loading of the zhfst file - voikkospell requires that the file is located within a dir named '3'. 2013-03-18T09:34:55+00:00
> Further improvements to the test run output. Template update. 2013-03-13T18:26:55+00:00

1952a3617,3618
> Second part of update to handle validation of generated documentation. Essentially whenever new documentation is created due to source files being changed, a forrest site is built. During that build process, any blocking issues with the generated jspwiki pages will be revealed, thus going a long way towards ensuring that such errors do not end up in svn and from there block the building of our public sites. 2013-02-21T12:57:26+00:00
> Added check for forrest as part of configuring the documentation extraction. Forrest will be used to validate the jspwiki documents during the build, to avoid that invalid documents enter the svn repository and corrupts the web page building. First step towards that goal. 2013-02-18T18:08:44+00:00
1954a3621,3622

1959a3631,3632
> Major update to the LexC testing. Now test data directly in the LexC code is supported by the python test script morph-tester.py (it reads the lexc files directly), which solves the bugs with multiple wordforms for the same morphosyntactic inflection. It is also a bit faster than the awk solution, and allows an unlimited number of different transducers to be tested dynamically directly in the lexc code. 2013-02-13T18:24:04+00:00

1979a3672,3673
> LEXICON names have been added to the propernouns.lexc file. Continuation files have been altered such that N-ava_01 reveals the following information: The first lexicon was a part-of-speech="noun" with the pattern attributed to the word ава and the tag "+N", and this lexicon leads to all subsequent tagging. In this way Nouns and proper nouns can utilise the same continuation lexica. 2013-01-17T09:39:46+00:00
> Checked in a bunch of lexc files that have been generated by xml. Moral: When changing .xml, compile, and then check in .lexc as well. This to make it possible to compile without having saxon etc. 2013-01-17T07:07:58+00:00

> Concatenate all LexC source files into one file explicitly, instead of letting hfst-lexc do it. This is more robust cross-platform, and makes the file used for transducer compilation easily available for debugging. Template update. 2013-01-11T12:47:29+00:00

1986a3686
> Rewrote LexC and TwolC Xerox rules to make them work on Cygwin: the Windows Xerox tools need a script file as input, the scripts can't be piped in as on *nix systems. Removed the hack in the previous commit. The bug can be worked around by avoiding linebreaks in the piped script. 2013-01-10T09:40:39+00:00
1987a3688,3689
> Added hack to work around a very strange bug in LexC transducer saving - the filename is slightly garbled if the save command is passed in from a script generated by a make file (but the same command passed in from a manually typed script works correctly). This hack is required for the new infra to work on the virtual Linux machines gtlab, gtoahpa, at least. The hack should be removed as soon as we have a correctly working LexC (the broken LexC is the newest one). 2013-01-08T10:06:02+00:00
> More robust Saxon/Java setup: no need to define CLASSPATH. The M4 macros will look for a couple of predefined pathnames, and pick the first saxon9he.jar file it finds. More locations should be added as needed. Also corrected the logic for reporting whether xslt transformation could be enabled or not, and added a warning if xml source files are found but no xml transformations could be enabled. 2013-01-04T17:18:53+00:00

> First step in making the digit transcriptor transducers work. The transducers are compiled, and are given proper names according to the fst naming conventions, and the Xerox transducers work in the digit-2-string direction. The Hfst transducers do not yet work (segmentation fault due to running out of memory because of an infinite recursion), and the string-2-digit direction is not yet in place. Still, moving forward towards a working system. 2012-12-13T00:03:29+00:00

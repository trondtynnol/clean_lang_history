> updating dict templates from und, to include the proper mobile/non-mobile spellrelax, orig_lang and semantic tag removal. 2013-12-06T01:14:18+00:00
> updating from template: r84648, two dict analysers, one with mobile spellrelax, and one without. Also removing certain semantic tags and orig_lang tags which prevent POS from being the first tag, and messing with lookups for NDS 2013-12-06T00:36:34+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Adding possibility to first look for specific regex creation shell script before falling back to a default shell script. This will allow us to create more complex or tailored regexes for certain tag sets (like the semantic tags), while having a reasonable fallback for other cases. 2013-12-02T09:06:13+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Keeping intermediate files didn't work, created an error. Now it works. 2013-12-01T21:15:02+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Further cleanup of semantic tag filtering: no processing of semantic filters in the shared makefiles. 2013-11-28T10:45:26+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added rules to generate regexes automatically from the list of extracted tags. First out is the regex to make semantic tags optional, and another to remove them completely. Also fixed file references in the relabel targets. 2013-11-25T19:41:33+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Moved tag extraction from tagsets to filters, as it has a more general use as the basis for dynamic filter construction. Tag extraction now works with both Xerox and Hfst, and handles both prefixed and suffixed tags. 2013-11-22T22:06:46+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Xerox will now stop on lexc syntax errors (done by replacing lexc with xfst - it was impossible to get lexc to stop; this is also how it is done in the old infrastructure). Hfst will not until (hfst_)foma is fixed, because foma doesn't stop on syntax errors. But one is better than none. 2013-11-22T13:10:38+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed one harmless but irritating warning. 2013-11-20T19:51:01+00:00

> [Template merge - und] YES! Finally got weighted automata working in the speller. Added missing hfst tools, and sorted all the hfst tools alphabetically. Updated the required hfst to version 3.5.1. Weighted speller automata are now the default (change the weights and what is weighted as needed pr. language).

> [Template merge - und] Changed voikko compression back to zip - gzip isn't voikko compatible. 2013-10-21T18:56:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] * FINALLY fixed the automake 1.11 vs 1.13 test incompatibilities. Now we can allow version 1.11, and still get the pretty output we want in newer automakes. * Fixed references to GTCORE in test scripts. Earlier we relied solely on it beingset in the environment, now we take it from configure (which can take it from the environment or from a script). 2013-10-21T14:28:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] One more gzip option fix. 2013-10-21T08:24:32+00:00

> [Template merke - und] The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure. Part 2 - now with shell script and Makefile. It's possible to make again. 2013-10-17T16:11:08+00:00
> [Template merke - und] The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure. Part 1 - no actual shell script, no Makefile. Comming in the next commit. NB! Right now making and building will break, sorry for the inconvenience. 2013-10-17T15:51:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added option to automatically create a language home dir environment variable. The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give a warning). As part of this change, I switched the shell from sh to bash, as I don't know how portable the extra code is with respect to other shells. 2013-10-17T07:56:17+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Changed back the Automake requirement to 1.11 - 1.12 is creating too much trouble. We'll have to see what to do with the test output - the version requirements change must be followed by another change that will substantially degrade test reports on newer automakes. 2013-10-16T17:19:36+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Made the check for GTCORE functional, looking for both the gt-core.sh script (and using its output if found), and the environment variable $GTCORE. This means that there is no need anymore to set the GTCORE variable as long as one configure, make and make install in the gtcore directory. 2013-10-16T16:50:46+00:00
> [Template merge] Corrected bug/feedback e-mail address to one actually working. 2013-10-14T07:00:14+00:00
> [template merge] Made LexC compilation break on error, at least for Xerox (Hfst only gives a warning for the same error tested). 2013-10-11T16:38:43+00:00
> [Template merge] Moved the compilation of remove-illegal-derivation-strings.regex from all langs to only the three Sámi langs actually using it. Even though potentially useful for more languages, it can hardly be considered a language universal... 2013-10-11T14:50:41+00:00

> [template merge] Corrected the --enable-grammarchecker option testing. 2013-10-08T17:02:38+00:00
> [template merge] Changed the order of the configure macros, to allow for testing for program availability when checking the enable options. 2013-10-08T16:55:28+00:00
> [template merge] Forgot to add the new Makefile to configure.ac. 2013-10-08T15:33:52+00:00
> [template merge] Added basic build infrastructure for a CG-based grammar checker. No template source files added yet, as this is still pretty experimental. The grammar checker is disabled by default (naturally). 2013-10-08T14:19:19+00:00
> Template merge: Copy-paste error introduced scanning of a subdir test that doesn't exist for any language but SME. Now corrected. 2013-10-04T15:25:56+00:00
> Template merge: Reorganised the phonetic build code to better support parallel phonetic transcription depending on the source language of loan words and foreign names. 2013-10-04T14:31:06+00:00
> Added check for the availability of 'see' when testing, to avoid bad fails on systems without 'see'. 2013-10-04T08:37:39+00:00
> Tempate merge: Added config feedback about vislcg3/syntactic parsing status. Added config check for the see tool (SubEthaEdit). 2013-10-04T07:53:49+00:00
> Template merge: Remove copying of the timestamp file for non-maintainers. It breaks the automatic merge, and requires a revision-explicit merge for each such language. Also added removal of originating language tags - they are only used in TTS. 2013-10-04T07:05:34+00:00
> Added compilation of the remove-orig_lang-tags filter. Sorted the filter targets alphabetically within each logical block. Template merge. 2013-10-04T05:20:26+00:00
> Improved and corrected configure feedback for spellers. Template merge. 2013-10-03T13:27:58+00:00
> Template merge: * Now all speller fst's are turned off by default (I missed a few in the previous commit). The configure feedback is slightly improved. * Corrected syntax error in a test. Improved config feedback further. 2013-10-03T12:44:18+00:00
> Template merge: Changed the default setup to only include morphological analysis and generation. This is done to reduce the build time during regular development. This means that to build spellers and other specialised fst's, they must now be enabled using ./configure.

> Documentation update: Added a file WhatIsThis, it shall contain a short explanation to outsider, as the name tells. 2013-07-09T10:08:36+00:00
> Renamed refs to template dir in preparation for support for multiple template dirs. Template update. 2013-06-29T20:44:20+00:00
> Commented out examples of error models for string and word pairs - they would in most cases add symbols to the error model not found in the acceptor, and this combination would crash the speller badly. Template update. 2013-06-25T08:17:53+00:00
> Cleaned up speller fst building, removing all unnecessary inverts and streamlining the code. Prepared for the introduction of weights, but commented out for now because of bugs or inefficiences in openfst. Renamed the included hfst speller build file, to follow an emerging naming standard for the include files. 2013-06-13T14:05:40+00:00
> Added support for making variant analysers and generators using the Apertium tag convensions. The generated transducers are still not fully Apertium-compatible but they are a major step forward. Template update. 2013-06-12T13:44:33+00:00
> Renamed analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst to generator-raw-gt-desc.hfst, to make the behavior in hfst-lookup explicit and clear. Still, the "generator" behaves as the Xerox "analyser" in hfst when in comes to composition and filtering. Confusing, I know. Template update. 2013-06-11T09:48:17+00:00
> Build the filter to remove CLB strings from speller transducers, and use it. Template update. 2013-06-10T13:40:31+00:00
> Added missing hfst tools. Removed commented-out code in the index.xml file. Template update. 2013-06-10T12:25:27+00:00

> Added string pairs and whole-word corrections to the speller error model. Added support for an ocr error model. Removed obsolete Voikko config file. Corrected bugs in the hfst M4 macros. Template update. 2013-06-06T23:22:21+00:00
> Moved the initial spell checker processing to the top spellchecker dir, to serve as the default starting point for all spell checkers. Template update. 2013-06-06T07:58:35+00:00

> Splitted and renamed the remove-morph-border filter. Rewrote a number of targets to reflect this. There are now three filters instead of one, to allow for more flexible fst building for speech processing. 2013-04-26T12:49:21+00:00
> Added gzip compression of foma speller transducer, and proper checks for prerequisites. Foma spellers can now be disabled, they are enabled by default. Template update. 2013-04-24T11:21:36+00:00
> Corrected a bug when building foma-based spellers. Changed one fst filename to follow the naming scheme for the new infra. Improved building of the zfst speller file. 2013-04-24T07:02:32+00:00
> For some reason wasn't the und.timestamp file updated during a template merge earlier this week. Now done. 2013-04-19T11:32:09+00:00
> Added processing of new filters. Template update. 2013-04-18T10:55:34+00:00
> Do not try to build hfst-based tools if hfst building is not enabled. Template update. 2013-04-15T09:46:48+00:00
> [feature] Moved some of the fst-speller building one level up, and added support for building foma-based spellers. Template update. 2013-04-11T16:51:27+00:00
> Renamed phonetics source and target files to reflect the actual purpose. Template update. 2013-04-10T05:50:34+00:00
> Add possibility to build morph segmenting automaton. Template update. 2013-04-09T21:56:28+00:00
> Added a top-level misc/ dir to hold private / non-svn files needed during development of the language. All files are ignored. 2013-04-09T19:54:22+00:00
> [bugfix] Corrected hfst text2ipa fst: the final fst needs to be inverted before being used in lookup. Template update. 2013-04-08T06:58:53+00:00
> [bugfix] Corrected the homonymy and variant filters used for generators - those tags should be optional, not completely removed. Template update. 2013-04-05T12:35:06+00:00
> [infra] We require gawk specifically, not any awk whatsoever. Improved config feedback. Template update. 2013-04-05T10:16:54+00:00
> [bugfix-infra] Corrected reference to the built fst's. Template update. 2013-03-20T17:03:42+00:00
> Updated the zhfst building to reflect recent changes in Voikko. There is now official support for zhfst speller files, but with a new location and no *.pro file. Also added simple support for local loading of the zhfst file - voikkospell requires that the file is located within a dir named '3'. 2013-03-18T09:34:55+00:00
> Further improvements to the test run output. Template update. 2013-03-13T18:26:55+00:00
> More tweaks to make the test output compact and readable. Template update. 2013-03-13T16:27:15+00:00
> Moved Oahpa transducer compilation to a separate (included) file, and added support for compiling dictionary transducers, also in a separate include file. Template update. 2013-03-13T11:48:35+00:00
> We need the last part of the path to properly identify the lexc file tested. Template update. 2013-03-13T10:16:59+00:00
> Made the morph-tester test runner (LexC and YAML tests) less verbose. All messages are one-liners, except for FAILs. Commented the code. Template update. 2013-03-13T09:26:17+00:00
> More thorough cleaning in src/morphology/. Template update. 2013-03-12T08:03:23+00:00
> Moved the definitions of the transducer variables to the Makefile.am, to make it possible to extend them by local modifications. Template update. 2013-03-11T09:13:03+00:00
> Forgot to update the src/filter/Makefile.am file. Template update. 2013-03-07T15:04:55+00:00
> Split the filter 'remove-dictionary-tags' in two to remove homonymy and variant tags separately. Template update. 2013-03-07T14:47:53+00:00
> Added filter to remove NGminip strings, ie paths that should not be used for generating miniparadigms in dictionaries. Template update. 2013-03-07T11:11:14+00:00
> Added infrastructure for building fst's for list-based spellers. The actual building is not yet implemented. Template update. 2013-03-06T07:19:50+00:00
> Remove doc build dir when cleaning. Template update. 2013-02-27T07:12:03+00:00
> Deleted files in obsolete locations. Moved one file not previously moved. 2013-02-26T23:57:43+00:00
> Forgot to update the config file. Template update. 2013-02-26T23:45:39+00:00
> Reorganised the tools/ dir to fit better with coming development. Template update. 2013-02-26T23:26:57+00:00
> Second part of update to handle validation of generated documentation. Essentially whenever new documentation is created due to source files being changed, a forrest site is built. During that build process, any blocking issues with the generated jspwiki pages will be revealed, thus going a long way towards ensuring that such errors do not end up in svn and from there block the building of our public sites. 2013-02-21T12:57:26+00:00
> Added check for forrest as part of configuring the documentation extraction. Forrest will be used to validate the jspwiki documents during the build, to avoid that invalid documents enter the svn repository and corrupts the web page building. First step towards that goal. 2013-02-18T18:08:44+00:00
> Upped the required automake version from 1.11 to 1.12, to avoid all hassles with the test harnesses and backwards compatibility. Template update. 2013-02-14T15:45:55+00:00
> These files should have been removed in the earlier commits regarding changes to the test bench, but where lost during the template merge earlier today, and not noticed until now. Finally deleted. 2013-02-14T15:26:19+00:00
> Even more portable testing... 2013-02-14T15:14:52+00:00
> Even more portable testing... 2013-02-14T10:44:31+00:00
> Improved portability & correctness of conditional tests in the morphology testing. Template merge. 2013-02-14T09:13:00+00:00
> Major update to the LexC testing. Now test data directly in the LexC code is supported by the python test script morph-tester.py (it reads the lexc files directly), which solves the bugs with multiple wordforms for the same morphosyntactic inflection. It is also a bit faster than the awk solution, and allows an unlimited number of different transducers to be tested dynamically directly in the lexc code. 2013-02-13T18:24:04+00:00
> Two more source files copied from gt/sme/src/. Template update. 2013-02-11T14:10:37+00:00
> Generated files checked in. 2013-01-26T12:25:46+00:00
> Added generated file. 2013-01-24T08:08:14+00:00
> Added links file. 2013-01-24T08:07:47+00:00
> Finally found out how to get the old test behaviour back. We want the serial tests, because it gives direct feedback to the linguists. Automake 1.13 uses parallel testing by default, which logs all test results to files. 2013-01-23T23:23:07+00:00
> Added support for processing twolc files for documentation extraction. 2013-01-23T21:41:04+00:00
> Some files may contain digits in their filename. Extended the filename match pattern for the Links target. Template update. 2013-01-23T21:02:34+00:00
> Added support for automatically building a file with links to each individual jspwiki file generated based. Template update. 2013-01-23T20:24:41+00:00
> Aajege has only been involved with the SMA source... 2013-01-23T16:14:04+00:00
> Forgot to add the jspwiki preamble file. Now added. 2013-01-23T15:11:44+00:00
> Forgot to add support for the conditional CAN_DOCC in the previous commit. Template update. 2013-01-22T17:38:39+00:00
> * Added initial support for extracting documentation from comments in the source code. Only jspwiki supported initially. * Also added initial support for extracting test data from source code comments. Only yaml tests in lexc is supported initially. 2013-01-22T16:48:30+00:00
> The final fix to get the XML-to-LexC conversion working on Cygwin. Template update. 2013-01-11T14:35:43+00:00
> Concatenate all LexC source files into one file explicitly, instead of letting hfst-lexc do it. This is more robust cross-platform, and makes the file used for transducer compilation easily available for debugging. Template update. 2013-01-11T12:47:29+00:00
> Corrected the host detection test for Cygwin. Template update. 2013-01-11T09:51:07+00:00
> Template updates: * Added support for XSL conversion of XML source files on Cygwin. * Made spell-relax a language-specific file. 2013-01-11T09:24:52+00:00
> Made Voikko support optional instead of required. Template update. 2013-01-10T10:38:26+00:00
> Rewrote LexC and TwolC Xerox rules to make them work on Cygwin: the Windows Xerox tools need a script file as input, the scripts can't be piped in as on *nix systems. Removed the hack in the previous commit. The bug can be worked around by avoiding linebreaks in the piped script. 2013-01-10T09:40:39+00:00
> Added hack to work around a very strange bug in LexC transducer saving - the filename is slightly garbled if the save command is passed in from a script generated by a make file (but the same command passed in from a manually typed script works correctly). This hack is required for the new infra to work on the virtual Linux machines gtlab, gtoahpa, at least. The hack should be removed as soon as we have a correctly working LexC (the broken LexC is the newest one). 2013-01-08T10:06:02+00:00

> Added one line to test svn commit. 2013-01-07T12:35:28+00:00
> More robust Saxon/Java setup: no need to define CLASSPATH. The M4 macros will look for a couple of predefined pathnames, and pick the first saxon9he.jar file it finds. More locations should be added as needed. Also corrected the logic for reporting whether xslt transformation could be enabled or not, and added a warning if xml source files are found but no xml transformations could be enabled. 2013-01-04T17:18:53+00:00
> Require at least HFST 3.4 - it includes all backends, and simplifies dependency handling quite a bit. Template update. 2013-01-03T16:32:23+00:00
> Fixed parsing of regexes for hfst, due to a bug in hfst-regex2fst when parsing regexes with comments after the regex is closed. Template update. 2012-12-19T09:22:48+00:00
> Refactored the yaml test code, moving duplicate parts to a separate file. Makes for much easier adaption to new transducer types, as well as much simplified maintenance. The svn merge test from sma turned out well - renaming files ahead of the merge seems to make the merge go smoother. 2012-12-18T14:12:10+00:00
> First step in making the digit transcriptor transducers work. The transducers are compiled, and are given proper names according to the fst naming conventions, and the Xerox transducers work in the digit-2-string direction. The Hfst transducers do not yet work (segmentation fault due to running out of memory because of an infinite recursion), and the string-2-digit direction is not yet in place. Still, moving forward towards a working system. 2012-12-13T00:03:29+00:00
> Made the yaml test scrips obey configuration options, ie only run the hfst tests if hfst is turned on at configuration time. Template update. 2012-12-12T21:52:39+00:00
> new dummy from sma, this one with uppar:lower like for number. 2012-12-12T00:05:18+00:00
> new dummy from sma, this one with uppar:lower like for number. 2012-12-12T00:01:59+00:00
> Automake requirement reduced to 1.11, after getting confirmation that that version is fine for finding Python (the main problem issue that triggered the version requirement). Template merge. 2012-11-29T09:44:43+00:00
> There's too much trouble with finding the correct Python version when using Automake v.1.10, causing a lot of frustration and wasted time for users. We thus require 1.12 from now on. Template update. 2012-11-29T07:30:10+00:00
> The noun lemma generation test script has been updated to only test the transducer types that have been turned on at configuration time. Template update. 2012-11-28T13:21:53+00:00
> This is after running the update-all-from-core.sh. 2012-11-21T09:34:18+00:00
> Grep out comments from regex files in orthography/, as there is a bug in hfst-regexp2fst. Also added an initial Hunspell include file. Template update. 2012-11-14T15:37:23+00:00
> Several updates: * slightly improved feedback from the configure script * improved hfst spell checker building * added basic support for building Oahpa transducers, *disabled* by default 2012-11-14T11:32:13+00:00
> Renamed 'dictionary' `spellerautomaton` in giellatekno.m4. The old variable name and printouts were confusing - 'dictionary' has manh meanings, and some very concrete ones in the context of the GT/Divvun work. Template update. 2012-11-14T05:28:47+00:00
> Minimise after every compose operation - always. Template update. 2012-11-12T08:21:41+00:00
> Bug fixes to the Saxon/Java configuration. Template update. 2012-11-06T13:55:09+00:00
> Call saxon checks from confugre. In previous commit: Ubuntu version of xml2lexc with autostuff. Template update. 2012-11-05T15:19:50+00:00
> Only check hfst version if requested using '--with-hfst', otherwise disable. Likewise, disable xfst if requested and print warning if both are disabled. Template update. 2012-11-05T13:44:16+00:00
> Added simple feedback to autogen.sh, valuable when processing many languages. Some reformatting of am-shared/hfst-spellchecker-include.am. 2012-10-30T08:51:56+00:00
> Fixed a simple syntax error in src/hyphenation/hyphenation.xfscript and src/phonetics/convert2ipa.xfscript. Now all languages finally build cleanly, thus making real errors easier to spot. 2012-10-30T07:57:50+00:00
> Removed double inversion from the hfst generator - it didn't work. Template update. 2012-10-27T09:41:29+00:00
> Tried to silence the build of transducers etc, but its effect is not very profound. Still it does make for nice and readable breaks in the stream of compiler messages, so I think it is an improvement. Merge from the template. 2012-10-26T12:14:45+00:00
> Make the silent build rules backwards compatible. Template update. 2012-10-26T09:42:47+00:00
> Enabled spellrelax functionality. Simplified compilation of hfst regex expressions. Corrected hfst filter compilation. Took the first steps in silencing the verbose make output. Update from the template. 2012-10-26T01:57:50+00:00
> hfst-preprocess-for-optimized-lookup-format has been removed from the hfst distribution. Merge from template. 2012-10-10T17:19:56+00:00
> Always fail hfst check if hfst-info can't be found. As it was, really old hfst installations were accepted as good-enough, which broke compilation really bad. Merge from template. 2012-10-09T16:28:09+00:00
> Add requirement of foma for hfst compilation; remove distinction between WANT_[HX]FST and CAN_[HX]FST. Merge from template. 2012-10-09T05:11:05+00:00
> Remove NBSP; Inspired by svn r63631, went through all files in gt and langs 2012-10-05T09:30:48+00:00
> The local modifications to Makefile.am files must be before the fallback pattern targets, it seems, otherwise the fallback targets are used. Template merge. 2012-10-04T15:33:20+00:00
> I believe I finally have fixed the yaml testing shell scripts, at least testing now works as intended in fao, izh, sma and smj. Merge from the template. 2012-10-04T10:24:44+00:00
> Escaping in the yaml test scripts didn't work - removing the single quotes did. Also added an underscore in front of the transducer string in the yaml testing, to avoid that the test scripts get too greedy when we get more transducers and test data. Merge from template. 2012-10-04T08:39:54+00:00
> Forgot to escape the single quotes used within the backtic expression. Small variable correction in the yaml test bench. Merge from template. 2012-10-03T16:55:27+00:00
> Corrected fail check in noun lemma generation test. Template merge. 2012-10-03T11:01:29+00:00
> Split the yaml test runner in two, one for norm and one for desc transducers, and updated the autoconf file correspondingly. Updated the lemma generator test to work with the renamed transducer. Made all test runners more robust. 2012-10-03T10:37:53+00:00
> Renamed the yaml test runner in anticipation of changes coming from the template. 2012-10-03T09:51:47+00:00
> Renamed all existing targets to follow the naming scheme defined at http://divvun.no/doc/infra/infraremake/TransducerNamesInTheNewInfra.html. Also added making of true normative and descriptive analysers and generators, as well as moved all of the hfst speller building to the tools/spellcheckers/hfstspeller/ dir. More explicit separation of local and central code in src/. 2012-10-02T16:40:19+00:00
> Added a simple header to the beginning of the compilation, to make it easier to spot each new language when building all languages in $GTHOME/langs/. Merge from the template. 2012-10-02T14:05:39+00:00
> With the recent fixes to regexp parsing in hfst-regexp2fst it was possible to bring the hfst compilation up to par with the Xerox compilation. In principle the Xerox and Hfst transducers should behave exactly the same - any deviation is a candidate bug in either the Xerox or the Hfst tools. This update requires hfst 3.3.14 to work properly, the requirement is added to the configure.ac file. 2012-10-02T10:33:50+00:00
> Removed references to newinfra/. Corrected info in INSTALL. 2012-09-25T18:04:03+00:00
> Added warning about missing YAML testing, with short instructions on how to enable them. Template update. 2012-09-25T06:19:32+00:00
> The top-level syntax include AM file had not been changed to reflect the rle->cg3 suffix change. Merge from template. The previous merge was incomplete due to a bug in the merge script. 2012-09-21T14:16:04+00:00
> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00
> The VislCG3 team has lately switched to a *.cg3 suffix. Now we do the same in the new infra - the new suffix is definitely more transparent. 2012-09-19T18:26:12+00:00
> Variables=cleaner code. Update from the template. 2012-09-18T06:56:51+00:00
> Updated the yaml test runner to properly report the exit value of the yaml tests, and also to give directions for how to see the details of each test if it failed. Update from the template. 2012-09-17T14:10:42+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00
> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00
> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> Enable yaml tests by magic. Merge from the template. 2012-09-14T11:54:49+00:00
> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00
> Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form. 2012-09-10T10:37:35+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. 2012-09-10T09:30:47+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. This makes compilation much easier, and should cause the present makefile to actually build spellers. Tommi already did this for FIN. 2012-09-10T09:25:01+00:00
> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00
> Add missing src to hfst spellchecker automaton path. Merge from template. 2012-09-08T13:00:22+00:00
> Added missing reference to dialect tag filter. Update from the template. 2012-09-08T08:42:58+00:00
> Updated my simplistic noun generation script to be aware of its new location. 2012-09-07T14:48:50+00:00
> Reorganised the test dir, in anticipation of a larger set of tools and source types in need of testing. Merge from the template. 2012-09-07T13:49:17+00:00
> Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox lookup tool. 2012-09-07T06:27:36+00:00
> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00
> Autoconf updates from the template. Intended goal: better hfst testing before enabling it. 2012-08-30T05:39:16+00:00
> Added border removal to the basic analyser and generator, such that they become useful. Also changed the order of the dir processing in src/, to ensure that the filters are built before they are needed. 2012-08-29T03:12:39+00:00

> Corrected syntax error. 2012-08-29T01:46:18+00:00
> Made the first test script more robust: it bails out if no transducer is found, and gives basic feedback to whether it is testing Xerox or Hfst. The test data files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected if needed, even after a successful test run. 2012-08-29T01:34:20+00:00

> updating dict templates from und, to include the proper mobile/non-mobile spellrelax, orig_lang and semantic tag removal. 2013-12-06T01:14:18+00:00
> updating from template: r84648, two dict analysers, one with mobile spellrelax, and one without. Also removing certain semantic tags and orig_lang tags which prevent POS from being the first tag, and messing with lookups for NDS 2013-12-06T00:36:34+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Adding possibility to first look for specific regex creation shell script before falling back to a default shell script. This will allow us to create more complex or tailored regexes for certain tag sets (like the semantic tags), while having a reasonable fallback for other cases. 2013-12-02T09:06:13+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Keeping intermediate files didn't work, created an error. Now it works. 2013-12-01T21:15:02+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a make warning, made generated regex files survive the build. 2013-12-01T09:44:14+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Further cleanup of semantic tag filtering: no processing of semantic filters in the shared makefiles. 2013-11-28T10:45:26+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added rules to generate regexes automatically from the list of extracted tags. First out is the regex to make semantic tags optional, and another to remove them completely. Also fixed file references in the relabel targets. 2013-11-25T19:41:33+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Reverted a change to hfst lexc compilation - the -f option doesn't work. 2013-11-23T10:46:08+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved tag extraction from tagsets to filters, as it has a more general use as the basis for dynamic filter construction. Tag extraction now works with both Xerox and Hfst, and handles both prefixed and suffixed tags. 2013-11-22T22:06:46+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Xerox will now stop on lexc syntax errors (done by replacing lexc with xfst - it was impossible to get lexc to stop; this is also how it is done in the old infrastructure). Hfst will not until (hfst_)foma is fixed, because foma doesn't stop on syntax errors. But one is better than none. 2013-11-22T13:10:38+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed one harmless but irritating warning. 2013-11-20T19:51:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Commented out weighting of the acceptor fst for the zhfst speller file - it causes a segfault in hfst-ospell. 2013-11-19T13:27:08+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a filter to remove dynamic derivation. 2013-11-18T09:57:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] YES! Finally got weighted automata working in the speller. Added missing hfst tools, and sorted all the hfst tools alphabetically. Updated the required hfst to version 3.5.1. Weighted speller automata are now the default (change the weights and what is weighted as needed pr. language). Thanks to Krister Lindén for giving instructions on how to get this working. 2013-11-15T09:25:30+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Changed build files to support Hfst 3.5, requires 3.5. 2013-10-28T09:24:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added LexSub string filter. 2013-10-23T15:14:45+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Changed voikko compression back to zip - gzip isn't voikko compatible. 2013-10-21T18:56:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] * FINALLY fixed the automake 1.11 vs 1.13 test incompatibilities. Now we can allow version 1.11, and still get the pretty output we want in newer automakes. * Fixed references to GTCORE in test scripts. Earlier we relied solely on it beingset in the environment, now we take it from configure (which can take it from the environment or from a script). 2013-10-21T14:28:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] One more gzip option fix. 2013-10-21T08:24:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed argument structure of gzip - zipping was broken for hfst and gramcheck. 2013-10-21T07:42:57+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Consistently use gzip instead of zip, and find gzip outside any conditionals. 2013-10-18T16:56:26+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Redirected command feedback of the analyser shell script to stderr, to avoid cluttering the analysed text in pipe use. 2013-10-18T13:22:58+00:00
> [Template merke - und] The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure. Part 2 - now with shell script and Makefile. It's possible to make again. 2013-10-17T16:11:08+00:00
> [Template merke - und] The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure. Part 1 - no actual shell script, no Makefile. Comming in the next commit. NB! Right now making and building will break, sorry for the inconvenience. 2013-10-17T15:51:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added option to automatically create a language home dir environment variable. The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give a warning). As part of this change, I switched the shell from sh to bash, as I don't know how portable the extra code is with respect to other shells. 2013-10-17T07:56:17+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Changed back the Automake requirement to 1.11 - 1.12 is creating too much trouble. We'll have to see what to do with the test output - the version requirements change must be followed by another change that will substantially degrade test reports on newer automakes. 2013-10-16T17:19:36+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Made the check for GTCORE functional, looking for both the gt-core.sh script (and using its output if found), and the environment variable $GTCORE. This means that there is no need anymore to set the GTCORE variable as long as one configure, make and make install in the gtcore directory. 2013-10-16T16:50:46+00:00
> [Template merge] Corrected bug/feedback e-mail address to one actually working. 2013-10-14T07:00:14+00:00

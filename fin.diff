< [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:47:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More improvements to the analysis regression check: undo space->underscore from lookup2cg (to avoid meaningless diffs when comparing to the new hfst-tokenise), and removed weight info. Also changed the dir ref for abbr.txt to ref the build dir, not the source dir, as that is where the file is generated. 2018-10-01T09:57:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved regression check script: check that the abbr file is built, for improved traditional tokenisation; and make the patch command silent, for less noise during testing. 2018-09-29T12:13:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Thanks to Børre, the analysis regression script will now remove diffs due to different handling of dynamic compounds when comparing old and new tokenisation. This makes it much easier to spot real differences between the two. 2018-09-25T10:10:13+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved shell script for analysis regression testing, so that in cases of no diffs it will only print a short message and continue. The test for no diff is also much faster than a real diff. Improves processing time a lot for large test corpora. 2018-09-25T06:57:58+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T17:21:50+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering to the rest of the build targets in src/. Also added grammar checker filtering. 2018-10-03T09:49:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:33:30+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected and improved the compilation of the analysers including the URL analysis. This should fix the problem with compiling SMA and other languages, and should in general reduce both compilation time and analyser size. The basic change was to union in the URL analysis as the last step in building the analysers, instead of early - the early injection led to fst blowup during minimisation. Now no blowup appears to take place. 2018-06-05T12:25:12+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building dictionary analysers for alternative orthographies, introduced in the changes yesterday. 2018-01-18T07:10:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify language variant, to allow testing spellers for alternative writing systems, alternative orthographies, different countries etc. 2018-01-18T06:35:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for area / country specific fst's for the specialised dict and oahpa build files. At the same time reorganised the build code so that targets with two variables now consistently use the fst type / suffix as the pattern, and the writing system/alt orth/area/etc as the function parameter. This should make the build system more robust by reducing the risk for accidental pattern similarity. 2018-01-17T11:37:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building area/country specific spellers. The target language for now is SMJ, but the feature is of course language independent and useful in a number of other circumstances. 2018-01-16T19:48:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed dialect fst filenames to follow existing patterns used for Oahpa fst's. 2018-01-16T14:42:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building dialect fst's. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a configure option. Also changed the disamb analyser to keep the dialect tags. Only normative fst's are filtered against dialect tags. 2018-01-16T12:39:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for building Area-specific analysers and generators (norm only). Also restored Area tags in the disamb and grammar checker analysers. Fixed missing support for Foma transducers in the alternative writing system support. 2018-01-16T07:44:07+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in fst format handling for the grammar checker - conflicting formats caused a segfault. Now using openfst-tropical for all fst's being processed in the grammarcheckers/ dir (presently only the speller acceptor analyser). 2018-01-15T08:51:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed OLang tag extraction and filter generation. 2018-01-12T13:19:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added weights to compounds in the language-indpendent build steps (languages without compounds will go through the same step, but will not be changed). Applied only to analysers. Also added spellrelax to the language-independent build of the analysers = it it always applied. 2018-01-12T11:58:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the previous fix: make sure it does not crash when the target file does not exist, and use the same test on all autogenerated tag lists. This should save a few more seconds of build time. 2018-01-12T08:33:08+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug #2355 so that the filters for semantic tags will only be rebuilt when there are real changes to the semantic tags. 2018-01-11T17:28:56+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building tokenisers where the morphological analysis tags are given in CG format directly instead of having to be postprocess by hfst-tokenise before being printed. The idea is to make the hfst-tokenise code more general, and move everything that is particular to one language or setup go into the fst instead of being hardcoded in the C++ code. There are some issues that must be resolved, but fst-wise the code works. 2017-08-24T11:33:54+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building a regex that transform all tags from the format "+Adv" to " Adv" (including space). The idea is to make the tags readily consumable by CG. Both prefix and suffix tags are converted. Newest giella-core required. 2017-08-24T10:02:20+00:00

> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> Enable yaml tests by magic. Merge from the template. 2012-09-14T11:54:49+00:00
> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00
> Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form. 2012-09-10T10:37:35+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. 2012-09-10T09:30:47+00:00
> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00

> Added missing reference to dialect tag filter. Update from the template. 2012-09-08T08:42:58+00:00
> Updated my simplistic noun generation script to be aware of its new location. 2012-09-07T14:48:50+00:00
> Reorganised the test dir, in anticipation of a larger set of tools and source types in need of testing. Merge from the template. 2012-09-07T13:49:17+00:00
> Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox lookup tool. 2012-09-07T06:27:36+00:00
> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00
> Autoconf updates from the template. Intended goal: better hfst testing before enabling it. 2012-08-30T05:39:16+00:00
> Added border removal to the basic analyser and generator, such that they become useful. Also changed the order of the dir processing in src/, to ensure that the filters are built before they are needed. 2012-08-29T03:12:39+00:00

> Corrected syntax error. 2012-08-29T01:46:18+00:00
> Made the first test script more robust: it bails out if no transducer is found, and gives basic feedback to whether it is testing Xerox or Hfst. The test data files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected if needed, even after a successful test run. 2012-08-29T01:34:20+00:00
> Added the first test script: it tests whether noun lemmas do generate. The script does contain some language-specific bits, and must thus be adapted to the requirements of each language. 2012-08-29T00:17:53+00:00

> Added build support for xml source files. Updates from the template. 2012-08-27T07:33:38+00:00
> Added initial support for xml source files. NB! The support isn't fully according to GNU (autotools) standards yet, but will have to do for the moment. 2012-08-25T07:24:18+00:00
> A lot of cleanup and corrections: * suffix rules in more places (although not in all - that is not possible) * removed automake warning about pattern rules - we need them * checked all *-include.am files for consistency, added missing Xerox and HFST targets were needed, corrected vars to HFST tools, added comments and generally made the files easier to maintain (I hope). 2012-08-24T13:34:02+00:00

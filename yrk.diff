> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00
> The VislCG3 team has lately switched to a *.cg3 suffix. Now we do the same in the new infra - the new suffix is definitely more transparent. 2012-09-19T18:26:12+00:00
> Variables=cleaner code. Update from the template. 2012-09-18T06:56:51+00:00

> Added generated lexc files to svn - to avoid compilation issues for people without java & saxon. This way the dependencies on external tools to build our linguistic tools is reduced, which is a good thing™. 2012-09-17T11:55:40+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00
> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00
> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> Enable yaml tests by magic. Merge from the template. 2012-09-14T11:54:49+00:00
> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00
> Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form. 2012-09-10T10:37:35+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. 2012-09-10T09:30:47+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. This makes compilation much easier, and should cause the present makefile to actually build spellers. Tommi already did this for FIN. 2012-09-10T09:25:01+00:00
> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00
> This file had escaped merging for one reason or another. Now it is up-to-date, and yrk is compiling again. 2012-09-08T14:33:28+00:00

> Updated my simplistic noun generation script to be aware of its new location. 2012-09-07T14:48:50+00:00
> Reorganised the test dir, in anticipation of a larger set of tools and source types in need of testing. Merge from the template. 2012-09-07T13:49:17+00:00
> Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox lookup tool. 2012-09-07T06:27:36+00:00
> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00

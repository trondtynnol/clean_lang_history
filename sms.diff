> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace tagging after the speller, to avoid that it creates trouble for the speller. That happens when whitespace error tags are applied to the word form that should be spell-checked. 2018-10-09T14:07:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to tag something as _only_ for the grammar checker, or _not_ for the grammar checker. Updated required giella-share version, due to new required filters. 2018-10-09T11:42:04+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed hyphen from the regular unknown alphabet, thereby reverting analysis of -foo as one (unknown) token, and instead back to two tokens. Added hyphen to alphamiddle, so that foo-bar will still be analysed as one big unknown token. 2018-10-09T08:51:54+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T17:21:50+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant.

The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:47:18+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Error messages are now copied from a source file to a build file, after bein validated. This allows support for VPATH builds and retains the integrity of the zcheck file. At the same time also replaced hard coded language names with automake variable expansion in the pipespec.xml.in file. 2018-01-22T10:59:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building dictionary analysers for alternative orthographies, introduced in the changes yesterday. 2018-01-18T07:10:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify language variant, to allow testing spellers for alternative writing systems, alternative orthographies, different countries etc. 2018-01-18T06:35:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for area / country specific fst's for the specialised dict and oahpa build files. At the same time reorganised the build code so that targets with two variables now consistently use the fst type / suffix as the pattern, and the writing system/alt orth/area/etc as the function parameter. This should make the build system more robust by reducing the risk for accidental pattern similarity. 2018-01-17T11:37:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building area/country specific spellers. The target language for now is SMJ, but the feature is of course language independent and useful in a number of other circumstances. 2018-01-16T19:48:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed dialect fst filenames to follow existing patterns used for Oahpa fst's. 2018-01-16T14:42:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building dialect fst's. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a configure option. Also changed the disamb analyser to keep the dialect tags. Only normative fst's are filtered against dialect tags. 2018-01-16T12:39:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for building Area-specific analysers and generators (norm only). Also restored Area tags in the disamb and grammar checker analysers. Fixed missing support for Foma transducers in the alternative writing system support. 2018-01-16T07:44:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Grammar checker .zcheck file should go into datadir, not libdir. 2018-01-15T11:55:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now using speller version info from configure.ac, not version.txt, which is removed. New giella-core required. 2018-01-15T10:40:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in fst format handling for the grammar checker - conflicting formats caused a segfault. Now using openfst-tropical for all fst's being processed in the grammarcheckers/ dir (presently only the speller acceptor analyser). 2018-01-15T08:51:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed OLang tag extraction and filter generation. 2018-01-12T13:19:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added weights to compounds in the language-indpendent build steps (languages without compounds will go through the same step, but will not be changed). Applied only to analysers. Also added spellrelax to the language-independent build of the analysers = it it always applied. 2018-01-12T11:58:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the previous fix: make sure it does not crash when the target file does not exist, and use the same test on all autogenerated tag lists. This should save a few more seconds of build time. 2018-01-12T08:33:08+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug #2355 so that the filters for semantic tags will only be rebuilt when there are real changes to the semantic tags. 2018-01-11T17:28:56+00:00

The output must be checked and tested, and the process may have to be rerun several times to get the desired hyphenation behavior. Removed outcommented build code from the old infra - the new build code is essentially just a reformulation of the old one. 2017-01-31T14:44:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for checking the version of the giella-common package (aka giella-shared/). Added two new regexes to the source file list for shared regexes. Updated the required version of Hfst - it has not been updated in ages. 2017-01-31T13:56:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further work on the pattern based hyphenators: added tra file template, which is used to 'translate'  non-ASCII chars to ascii only for the pattern creation process. Initial build steps for the pattern build. 2017-01-31T12:26:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the fst-based hyphenator by removing irrelevant paths from the fst. Started work on the pattern-based hyphenator, based on code from the old infra. 2017-01-31T11:12:44+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Finished first version of fst-based hyphenator: now includes plain rules as a fall-back solution (including for misspelled words), and Err-tagged forms get a high weight penalty. In general, this seems to give good hyphenation patterns if one pick the first (lowest-weight) one. 2017-01-30T13:51:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First version of lexicon-based and fst-based hyphenation done. Works, but misses capitalised words, and does not give extra weights to Err-tagged word forms. Also no hyphenation of misspelled words yet. Hyphenation builds are off by default. 2017-01-30T12:14:37+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure test to check that there is actually data in GIELLA_SHARED. 2016-08-18T08:04:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The giella-shared data dir is now found using several techniques in the following order: * env. variable GIELLA_SHARED * env. variable GIELLA_HOME * env. variable GTHOME * env. variable GTCORE * using --with-giella-shared=/dir/to/giella-shared * using pkg-config If all these fail, configure errors out. Since it a.o. uses GTHOME, the change should be of no concern to existing users having checked out everything. And since the svn location is still within GTCORE, it will also work for those checking out only the core and a single or a couple of languages without any action on their part. 2016-08-17T13:00:38+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] The next batch of changes to support building hfst fst's with a specified backend fst format: desktop spellers are now supported. The speller fst's will be built using the specified backend format up to the point where corpus and tag weights are added, when the fst format will be changed to the default (openfst-tropical) format. That is, even if you specify (the unweighted) sfst as the backend format, the final speller will still be weighted. 2016-06-06T10:18:24+00:00

> The two files have been corrected save ONE problem in Workbook1-fin-sms_2015-02-14_P03.xml. Item <p id=_6_>vuiʹm esim. tovereiden k. taaurõõžživuiʹm</p> contains TWO languages. Item <p id=_2_>kanssa</p> as seen in <p id_3_ is a postpostition. The morpheme _vuiʹm_, however, at the beginning of <p id_6_> is the Pl.Com. The abbreviation _esim._ means _for example_ in Finnish. Then comes Finnish-language example _tovereiden k._ => _tovereiden kanssa_ AND Skolt Sami translation _taaurõõžživuiʹm_. 2015-02-25T00:29:59+00:00

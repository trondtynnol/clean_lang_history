< [Template merge - langs/und] The last hyphenation build fix: now also works with other than the default fst backend, e.g. with the foma backend. 2020-04-27T08:48:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed a double target declaration, one from the old pattern-based build, and one from the fst build. It was a simple copy from fst to pattern, and is not needed anymore. 2020-04-27T07:59:57+00:00
< fixed a file name in src/Makefile.am that caused the build to fail 2020-04-27T07:42:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated referenced filename. Old name was not found, and stopped all builds. 2020-04-26T16:08:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Restored file that was accidentally deleted, also renamed it to the correct name after the dir reorg. 2020-04-26T08:58:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] One reference to an old filename corrected. Stopped all nightlies. 2020-04-25T21:18:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removing the last remnants of the old hyphenation directory structure. 2020-04-24T20:33:48+00:00

< a major re-design of the guesser: introducing flag diacritics to scan the word, and changing the way lexicon-based and guessed words transducers are combined; the guesser is far from finished 2020-04-24T15:23:37+00:00
< X ja ... pattern added to pronoun-verb agreement error patterns 2020-04-24T14:18:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot one file to be copied up one dir level, now done. 2020-04-24T13:57:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Step one in flattening the tools/hyphenators/ dir tree: copying and renaming make files, copying the filter dir. The files are not yet connected. Also preparing new build instruction file. 2020-04-24T12:28:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added missing quote mark „ that caused unwanted behaviour in tokenisation. 2020-04-23T07:22:11+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated references to dir names in giella-shared: requires new version of giella-common. Updated some test scripts to refer to the new dir names. 2020-04-23T06:30:53+00:00
< morphology/ -> fst/. 2020-04-23T05:36:36+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added dynamic construction of a regex of flag diacritics found in tokeniser fst's. The regex is used to ensure that flag diacritics are considered epsilons at token boundaries. Fixes a number of tokenisation bugs. 2020-04-22T09:18:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A glaring miss stopped all nightly builds. Thanks to Tino for pointing out. 2020-04-22T05:41:20+00:00
< Restored previous content, that was overwritten by a not-so-thought-through conflict resolution command. 2020-04-21T17:04:13+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/ to src/cg3/, and updated all references to it. Part of the large restructuring, and a test case for more complex renaming. 2020-04-21T13:37:09+00:00
< Fixes to language specific build steps to make the phonology build work again. 2020-04-21T07:27:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More cleanup after removing src/phonology/*: all references to it have been replacecd, and the file am-shared/src-phonology-dir-include.am has been removed. 2020-04-21T06:55:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to remove src/phonology/Makefile from configure.ac. Duh. 2020-04-20T18:36:24+00:00
< Deleted src/phonology/ dir after all source files have been moved to src/morphology/. Some files have been renamed. All builds should continue to work as before. 2020-04-20T14:19:27+00:00
< Fixing documenation file ref and filename after the source file move. 2020-04-20T12:17:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed documentation extraction & building to get the source doc in src/morphology/. 2020-04-20T12:02:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The big switch: building phonology files are now changed from src/phonology/ to src/morphology. Documentation is still built in the old location, but will be moved separately due to higher conflict risk. 2020-04-20T11:19:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Update phonology filename in src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am. 2020-04-20T07:29:47+00:00
< some trivial rules 2020-04-19T16:31:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Copy src/phonology/Makefile.am to src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am and src/phonology/xxx-phon.twolc to src/morphology/phonology.twolc as step one in moving the file. Then the build can switch, and finally, the old files can be deleted. 2020-04-18T16:07:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected copy-paste bug in the build steps for areal grammar checker analysers. The bug caused SMJ to fail. 2020-04-17T06:33:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug with multiple declarations of EXTRA_DIST and noinst_DATA in the previous template merge. 2020-04-17T06:11:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for moving the phonology files inside morphology/ (later to be renamed fst/). 2020-04-17T05:53:53+00:00
< typo 2020-04-15T08:35:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised mt/apertium make files so that fixed content is in Makefile.am, and userj-editable content is in Makefile.modifications.am. 2020-04-07T12:58:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Started splitting the local Makefile.am in two, by moving it to a new filename, and then create a new Makefile.am that just includes the moved one. In later commmits, some of the content can be moved from one file to the other. 2020-04-06T11:56:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed the remaining cases of improved upper-lower case configurable processing. Removed a variable from configure.ac with comments, turned out it wasn't needed. 2020-04-05T11:19:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First step in fixing default case handling: downcasing of derived proper nouns can now be turned off for the standard fst's by changing a test in configure.ac. 2020-04-03T12:42:48+00:00
< This Estonian analyser uses another system for handling downcasing of derived nouns. We thus set the value to false, to avoid using the default setup. 2020-04-03T12:41:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in phonology compilation when there are multiple phonology files: temporary files were deleted before being used due to name overlap. 2020-03-31T07:24:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added Automake variables to handle demanding or non-default uppercasing, or writing systems with no case distinction at all. 2020-03-30T13:43:49+00:00
< removed (for now) guesser from the raw transducer; the first error rules by Kaili for grammar checker, and one error described in errors.xml 2020-02-25T15:53:09+00:00
< guesser now covers also verbs and to some extent words that are declined with an apostrophe (e.g. Braille'st) 2020-02-21T18:24:21+00:00
< forgot to add the skript to upcase guessed proper names 2020-02-20T09:40:34+00:00
< adding a guesser makes the descriptive analyzer 3 times bigger than before; in an (unsuccessful) attempt to diminish it I gave up the previous way of decoding every sound with lowercase|uppercase version, and added a filter instead that up-cases the initial letter of a name. the guesser currently accepts only Estonian letters and a few foreign ones. 2020-02-19T17:08:50+00:00
< guesser-related improvements: fixed a bug in twolc (vowel shortening); modified makefile so that now guessed simplex words do not derive into smth else; slightly improved simplex word guessing 2020-02-18T13:41:04+00:00
< now we have a guesser for simplex words 2020-02-13T16:50:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Adding |{➤}|{•} to pmscript. 2019-12-16T08:08:15+00:00
< introduced trigger {E} for -el/er ending words like piksel 2019-12-12T18:26:15+00:00
< docu 2019-12-04T14:38:19+00:00
< added 2600 words to lexicon by importing a newer vabamorf lexicon; added -nd (for -nud) as a NotNorm affix, and classified some verbs so that their NotNorm forms are analysed now (töödata, naasema etc) 2019-11-29T22:07:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added ‹ and › to the list of possible punctuation marks in the tokenisers. 2019-11-15T12:26:48+00:00
< Use # for word boundaries at this point. The next step in the speller fst build process will have the # removed, so that would be the correct place to add the tests as they were. Adjusted Makefile.am correspondingly. 2019-11-12T08:29:32+00:00
< Initial ATT file for a keyboard layout adjusted error model. This layout error model is based on SMA, as we don’t have any layouts for EST yet. SMA is pretty close though, and good enough for initial testing and playing with. 2019-11-12T08:28:00+00:00
< Correct variable syntax and variable name 2019-11-12T08:26:20+00:00
< Added a single yaml test just to make the test pass. More tests can be added if needed. Updated Makefile.am accordingly. 2019-11-12T08:02:08+00:00
< More test scripts accidentally deleted now restored, deleted in svn rev 163954. 2019-11-12T07:51:51+00:00
< Update the call to the test runner. 2019-11-12T07:38:04+00:00
< Undeleted files that were removed in rev. 174629. Even though they may not be used, they should be kept in svn. The tests will only be run if there are corresponding yaml files, and keeping them around makes est/ follow the rest of the languages. And if removed, the corresponding changes must be made also in the Makefile.am. I assume they were deleted by accident. 2019-11-12T07:32:47+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added Makefile setting for enabling swaps in error models (ie ab -> ba). Default is no (as this used not to work, and the existing error models are based on this fact). 2019-11-06T16:53:03+00:00
< some changes to appease make check 2019-11-05T16:47:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Replace UNDEFINED with __UNDEFINED__, so that text replacement can take place. 2019-10-24T08:39:00+00:00
< Updated ignore patterns. 2019-10-23T18:25:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] tools/mt/Makefile.am needs am-shared/lookup-include.am as well. 2019-10-22T09:17:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add cgbased to the SUBDIRS variable in tools/mt/Makefile.am. 2019-10-22T08:30:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added basic support for CG-based machine translation. Ongoing work. 2019-10-22T07:20:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure some jspwiki header files for generated documentation are included in the distro. 2019-10-16T06:08:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to disable Forrest validation when Forrest is installed. This reduces build time and annoying warnings for people not working on the documentation. Default is still to do Forrest validation. 2019-10-14T10:47:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Wrapped command line tools in double quotes, to protect against spaces in pathnames. Spaces will occur when building on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux, as locations such as 'Program Files' are included in the default search path. 2019-10-10T07:24:00+00:00
< Force unix line endings, to make sure it works ok also on the Windows subsystem for Linux. 2019-10-07T17:04:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved build process for pattern hyphenators - now patgen config is done programmatically instead of interactively. The values are configured in the Makefile.am. 2019-10-02T21:59:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added script for testing tag coverage, made by Kevin, and originally for sme. 2019-09-17T08:35:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for multiple whitespace analysers. 2019-09-05T07:12:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for comments in error model text files. Added support for zipped but uncompressed files (required by divvunspell for now). 2019-09-04T20:28:04+00:00
< The last traces of Konrad Nielsen removed from our languages. 2019-08-13T07:28:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added simple shell script to easily run the grammar checker test tool, and considering build directories etc. 2019-08-09T11:49:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Generate and compile the new filter for removing semantic tags in front of derivations. Require new version of the giella-core because of dependencies. 2019-06-14T11:03:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure all generated files have a suffix that will make them be ignored. Added comments to clarify. 2019-06-14T07:45:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Børre updated the documentation url to point to giellalt.uit.no. 2019-06-14T07:08:52+00:00
< Updating svn ignores for tools/analysers/. 2019-06-14T06:33:54+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed most of the old hyph files not needed anymore. 2020-04-24T17:38:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Switched build to new, shallower build structure. The old files and dirs are still there, but not used. 2020-04-24T16:31:34+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot one file to be copied up one dir level, now done. 2020-04-24T13:58:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step one in flattening the tools/hyphenators/ dir tree: copying and renaming make files, copying the filter dir. The files are not yet connected. Also preparing new build instruction file. 2020-04-24T12:37:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added missing quote mark „ that caused unwanted behaviour in tokenisation. 2020-04-23T07:31:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated references to dir names in giella-shared: requires new version of giella-common. Updated some test scripts to refer to the new dir names. 2020-04-23T06:47:02+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] The second big renaming: src/morphology/ -> src/fst/. All build, test and config files are updated. `make` and `make check` works for sma. 2020-04-22T19:33:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added dynamic construction of a regex of flag diacritics found in tokeniser fst's. The regex is used to ensure that flag diacritics are considered epsilons at token boundaries. Fixes a number of tokenisation bugs. 2020-04-22T09:26:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] A glaring miss stopped all nightly builds. Thanks to Tino for pointing out. 2020-04-22T05:42:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/ to src/cg3/, and updated all references to it. Part of the large restructuring, and a test case for more complex renaming. 2020-04-21T18:05:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More cleanup after removing src/phonology/*: all references to it have been replacecd, and the file am-shared/src-phonology-dir-include.am has been removed. 2020-04-21T07:10:14+00:00
> Change references to phonology/XXX-phon.yyy in the section for language specific modifications. 2020-04-21T06:58:15+00:00

> Deleted src/phonology/ dir after all source files have been moved to src/morphology/. Some files have been renamed. All builds should continue to work as before. 2020-04-20T14:20:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed documentation extraction & building to get the source doc in src/morphology/. 2020-04-20T12:05:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] The big switch: building phonology files are now changed from src/phonology/ to src/morphology. Documentation is still built in the old location, but will be moved separately due to higher conflict risk. 2020-04-20T11:36:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Update phonology filename in src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am. 2020-04-20T07:29:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Copy src/phonology/Makefile.am to src/morphology/Makefile.modifications-phon.am and src/phonology/xxx-phon.twolc to src/morphology/phonology.twolc as step one in moving the file. Then the build can switch, and finally, the old files can be deleted. 2020-04-18T16:05:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected copy-paste bug in the build steps for areal grammar checker analysers. The bug caused SMJ to fail. 2020-04-17T06:36:43+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug with multiple declarations of EXTRA_DIST and noinst_DATA in the previous template merge. 2020-04-17T06:16:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for moving the phonology files inside morphology/ (later to be renamed fst/). 2020-04-17T05:59:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised mt/apertium make files so that fixed content is in Makefile.am, and userj-editable content is in Makefile.modifications.am. 2020-04-07T13:54:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Started splitting the local Makefile.am in two, by moving it to a new filename, and then create a new Makefile.am that just includes the moved one. In later commmits, some of the content can be moved from one file to the other. 2020-04-06T11:57:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed the remaining cases of improved upper-lower case configurable processing. Removed a variable from configure.ac with comments, turned out it wasn't needed. 2020-04-05T11:19:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First step in fixing default case handling: downcasing of derived proper nouns can now be turned off for the standard fst's by changing a test in configure.ac. 2020-04-03T13:08:27+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in phonology compilation when there are multiple phonology files: temporary files were deleted before being used due to name overlap. 2020-03-31T07:26:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Automake variables to handle demanding or non-default uppercasing, or writing systems with no case distinction at all. 2020-03-30T13:47:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Adding |{➤}|{•} to pmscript. 2019-12-16T08:22:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added ‹ and › to the list of possible punctuation marks in the tokenisers. 2019-11-15T12:37:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added Makefile setting for enabling swaps in error models (ie ab -> ba). Default is no (as this used not to work, and the existing error models are based on this fact). 2019-11-06T17:22:29+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replace UNDEFINED with __UNDEFINED__, so that text replacement can take place. 2019-10-24T14:20:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] tools/mt/Makefile.am needs am-shared/lookup-include.am as well. 2019-10-22T09:18:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add cgbased to the SUBDIRS variable in tools/mt/Makefile.am. 2019-10-22T08:34:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added basic support for CG-based machine translation. Ongoing work. 2019-10-22T07:30:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure some jspwiki header files for generated documentation are included in the distro. 2019-10-16T06:13:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to disable Forrest validation when Forrest is installed. This reduces build time and annoying warnings for people not working on the documentation. Default is still to do Forrest validation. 2019-10-14T10:57:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Wrapped command line tools in double quotes, to protect against spaces in pathnames. Spaces will occur when building on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux, as locations such as 'Program Files' are included in the default search path. 2019-10-10T09:44:31+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved build process for pattern hyphenators - now patgen config is done programmatically instead of interactively. The values are configured in the Makefile.am. 2019-10-02T22:19:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added script for testing tag coverage, made by Kevin, and originally for sme. 2019-09-17T08:42:15+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for multiple whitespace analysers. 2019-09-05T07:12:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for comments in error model text files. Added support for zipped but uncompressed files (required by divvunspell for now). 2019-09-05T04:07:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added simple shell script to easily run the grammar checker test tool, and considering build directories etc. 2019-08-09T12:10:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Generate and compile the new filter for removing semantic tags in front of derivations. Require new version of the giella-core because of dependencies. 2019-06-14T11:08:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure all generated files have a suffix that will make them be ignored. Added comments to clarify. 2019-06-14T08:25:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Børre updated the documentation url to point to giellalt.uit.no. 2019-06-14T07:08:18+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added UpCase function to the tokenisers, to handle all-upper variants of the input side. It does almost double the size of the fst, but at least it is just one additional line of code. Also, it does only work in Linux/using glib (for other platforms it is restricted to Latin1 - still, that covers a major portion of the Sámi fst's and running text, so much better than nothing). 2019-03-22T14:30:22+00:00
< minor improvements in abbreviations 2019-03-19T09:57:52+00:00
< lexical language script lexlang.xfscript now working for hfst-xfst; guesser-related tag(s) not included. some irrelevant symbol bugs fixed in abbreviations 2019-03-18T15:44:03+00:00
< tried to describe el/er ending words differently: instead of symbol E2 which was used instead of e, now a new complicated 2-level rule deletes e, based on context. so words in stem lexicon look more natural. exceptions to 2-level rule are still with E2, or by putting words in a different cont. lexicon. lexlang script that should define the lexical language is not working at present... 2019-03-15T19:14:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Ensure that the correct grammar checker pipeline is the default one, so that it will be executed when no pipeline is specified. 2019-03-13T08:45:12+00:00
< small improvements in compounding; paired words now together in the same transducer with simplex words (earlier they were separate) 2019-03-06T13:02:51+00:00
< added verbal derivation +Der/is, some simplex words and flags to some words in order to increase both recall and precision 2019-03-05T16:43:54+00:00
< pron__u__nciation 2019-03-03T14:38:07+00:00
< more work on compounding; fixed a bug in verbal us-derivation that resulted in output of similar lines (because the lines contained a different flag diacritic) 2019-03-01T20:39:55+00:00
< now the symbols get processed (almost) as intended 2019-02-28T18:42:34+00:00
< made compound combinatorics a little bit better still; some more 3 and 4 letter words prohibited from forming compounds (with various strictness), and more compound words (that became illegal by the new rules) added to the lexicon. proper nouns now classified into geo names, persons and other 2019-02-28T17:39:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the new multichar +Symbol to the multichar definitions. 2019-02-28T07:21:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed sub-post tag for symbols from +ABBR to +Symbol. Needs to be declared as multichar in each language. 2019-02-27T13:28:21+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2019-02-27T10:21:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for shared Symbol file: build rules, affix file, modifications to root.lexc. Also increased required version of giella-common, to make sure that the shared stem file is actually there. 2019-02-26T08:52:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed dir name typo that broke compilation. 2019-02-25T18:10:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building an analyser tool. This is in practice an xml-specified pipeline identical to what is used in the grammar checker, but where the pipeline does text analysis instead of grammar checking. Also made grammar checkers and mobile spellers part of the --enable-all-tools configuration. 2019-02-25T15:37:11+00:00

< compounding made somewhat more strict and precise, by placing flag diacritics for individual words in lexicons (using scripts in import) 2019-02-21T18:22:53+00:00
< fiddled with flag diacritics to get compounding more restrictive; and added weights for lemmas (based on 15 mio corpus freq. dict), to get frequent words lifted upwards in output; commented guesser out for testing 2019-02-15T20:42:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter to remove the +MWE tag from the grammar checker generator. It blocked generation of some word forms (and should not be visible in any case). 2019-02-13T07:44:29+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Make the mobile keyboard layout error model work properly (ie on input  longer than one char) by circumfixing it with any-stars. 2019-01-17T19:08:20+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First round of improved handling of compilation errors in shell pipes: instruct make to delete targets when some of the intermediate steps fail. 2019-01-11T12:34:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure.ac conditional to control whether spellers for alternative orthographies are built. The default is 'true'. Set this to 'false' for historical or other orthographies for which a speller is not relevant. 2019-01-09T10:34:50+00:00

< compiling did not work, copied from fkv 2019-01-09T09:03:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fix broken hfst builds of xfscript files when there is no final newline in the source file (caused the save command to be shaddowed by the final line of text, usually a comment, so no file was saved, and thus there was nothing to work on for the next build step). 2019-01-09T08:56:21+00:00
< first attempt to add weights; in src/makefile.am and root.lexc. now the output cohorts are ordered so that more complex ones are down below, and +Use/Rare are down below, and less frequent grammatical categories are in lower lines 2019-01-08T15:40:26+00:00
< added frequency wordform list 2019-01-08T12:36:04+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Apply alternate orthography conversion after hyphenation marks have been removed, but before the morphology marks are deleted. Especially word boundaries are useful for certain types of conversion, but other borders will likely be useful as well. The conversion scripts need to take the border marks into consideration. 2019-01-08T08:55:05+00:00
< Ignore compiled cg3 files in tools/tokenisers/. 2019-01-08T07:06:40+00:00
< Ignore more files, including files that are automatically added to svn when populating a new language. This is done to avoid them showing up as noise for external languages, in which case these files might not be in our svn (but in the external svn repo instead). 2019-01-08T06:56:01+00:00
< Reverted a number of things back to r172686, because my attempts to simplify the morph. description by adding KAVA to 1C (and modifying other 1C words to fit the new system) resulted in more complex twol rules. And crucially, the stem illative of seminar (TAUD): seminari and oleskelu (KAVA): oleskellu are probably impossble to describe in a uniform and simple manner. 2019-01-06T20:20:15+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved Easter egg generation, using the improved script in giella-core. Increased the required giella-core version correspondingly. 2018-12-14T09:11:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Cleaned the HFST_MINIMIZE_SPELLER macro, and also its use. No need to include push weights anymore, it is done always, for all speller fst's. 2018-12-13T10:12:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Push weights for all final fst's, + optimise error model. 2018-12-13T09:56:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed how the att file is produced. From now on it should be built once, and then added to svn. The att file will usually not change, and storing it in svn will avoid rebuilding it every time. Also changed the compression. 2018-12-12T14:51:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for adapting the error model to the mobile keyboard layout for the language in question. 2018-12-11T14:17:07+00:00
< rename locatives to locatives_plus and other similar style changes 2018-12-04T11:06:45+00:00

< a modified yaml-test that I forgot to commit last time 2018-11-26T10:07:37+00:00
< rules of referral in paradigms (affixes) and 2-level rules changed; a step towards more uniform representation of declinations (and probably even more complex 2-level rules) 2018-11-23T20:38:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Two more places to remove the Use/-GC and the MWE tags: mt and speller fst's. Now done. 2018-11-06T07:48:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Had forgotten to remove the Use/-GC tag in the core fst's, only from all the others. Now fixed. 2018-11-05T15:51:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Step 2 in blocking dynamic compounds of MWE tagged entries: moved all MWE tag processing away from the *-raw-* targets to the specific *.tmp targets. This way the MWE tags will survive long enough to be available for the blocking done in the tokeniser fst's. Tested in SME, and seems to work as intended. 2018-11-05T08:39:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added step 1 in blocking dynamic comounds between an MWE and another noun: added new filter that will turn the MWE tag into a flag diacritic. Increased required giella-common version number due to the new filter. 2018-11-02T11:16:04+00:00
< re-organised and simplified flag diacitics (aim: to make the whole stuff easier to understand); the lexlang.xfscript currently does not express the lexical language (punctuation-related tags are missing) 2018-10-29T15:24:22+00:00
< just some cleanup, no real changes 2018-10-26T17:23:04+00:00
< tokeniser pmscript needs flags explicitly listed; the tokeniser now works the same as for sme and vro 2018-10-24T14:13:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug when building the punctuation file - the required subdir was not made. 2018-10-24T08:32:02+00:00
< harmonized the lexicon with the generated punctuation; now the tokeniser analyses a separate comma as +CLB, although it doesn't separate it as a token: ja, is tokenised as ja (with , just being lost) 2018-10-22T20:26:08+00:00
< punctuation now in raw analyser, but tokeniser still not reckognising it 2018-10-22T13:44:02+00:00
< Rejected the idea that a word containing up to 2 hyphens may be built from indivifdual words, by just inserting hyphens. As a consequence, had to include acronyms on par with other words in the stems directory, and add them to the root.lexc compounding lexicon mess. morpholgy/Makefile.am needs attention on GENERATED_LEXC_SRCS= 2018-10-19T20:38:27+00:00
< added a lexical language defining xfscript for documentation and testing purposes; probably in a wrong directory (src/morphology) 2018-10-17T13:48:00+00:00
< Copy in the shared punctuation file from giella-shared. 2018-10-16T12:01:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the whitespace analyser almost to the beginning of the pipeline, directly after the tokeniser+analyser. This is to be able to support sentence boundary detection, as the whitespace analyser will give some valuable tags for that. 2018-10-12T14:05:29+00:00
< added 2 yaml scripts that were missing from svn (no idea how this came to be...) 2018-10-12T08:25:21+00:00
< yaml tests were meant for a descriptive ana/gene transducer, but they were located and named as -norm-; now they are renamed and relocated to -desc- 2018-10-12T08:01:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in a configuration option - dekstop instead of desktop. Thanks to our friends in Nuuk for noticing. 2018-10-11T15:54:45+00:00
< fixed some bugs that had slipped in during re-makes over summer; the hfst version analyzes like in May 2018 2018-10-11T11:18:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a misplaced dependency that caused url.hfst to be rebuilt on every make, and thus trigger other rebuilds. Not anymore. 2018-10-09T14:42:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace tagging after the speller, to avoid that it creates trouble for the speller. That happens when whitespace error tags are applied to the word form that should be spell-checked. 2018-10-09T14:07:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to tag something as _only_ for the grammar checker, or _not_ for the grammar checker. Updated required giella-share version, due to new required filters. 2018-10-09T11:42:04+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace chars to the blank regex, thereby reinstating the old compilation speed. Thanks to Kevin and Tino for noticing and suggesting the improvement. Also added comment to document what incondform is supposed to contain, again thanks to Kevin. 2018-10-09T10:01:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed hyphen from the regular unknown alphabet, thereby reverting analysis of -foo as one (unknown) token, and instead back to two tokens. Added hyphen to alphamiddle, so that foo-bar will still be analysed as one big unknown token. 2018-10-09T08:51:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the tokenisation disambigutation file to the compiled and installed targets. 2018-10-09T07:32:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T17:21:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed two build bugs: abbr.txt was only autogenerated when building with hfst, and the url.?fst file was not properly generated from url.tmp.?fst. 2018-10-04T10:58:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in MT compilation - pattern rules are not used, but new filenames still had them due to copy-paste error. 2018-10-04T08:40:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering also to MT and spellcheckers. Now all tools and fst's should be covered. 2018-10-04T07:53:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add pmatch filtering to the default targets in src/ - duh. Now done. 2018-10-04T07:31:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering to the rest of the build targets in src/. Also added grammar checker filtering. 2018-10-03T09:49:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:33:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More improvements to the analysis regression check: undo space->underscore from lookup2cg (to avoid meaningless diffs when comparing to the new hfst-tokenise), and removed weight info. Also changed the dir ref for abbr.txt to ref the build dir, not the source dir, as that is where the file is generated. 2018-10-01T09:52:30+00:00
< some small bugfixes; but still xerox lookup cannot generate a wordform for +Par 2018-09-29T12:13:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved regression check script: check that the abbr file is built, for improved traditional tokenisation; and make the patch command silent, for less noise during testing. 2018-09-29T12:05:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Thanks to Børre, the analysis regression script will now remove diffs due to different handling of dynamic compounds when comparing old and new tokenisation. This makes it much easier to spot real differences between the two. 2018-09-25T10:10:09+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2018-09-25T08:25:04+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved shell script for analysis regression testing, so that in cases of no diffs it will only print a short message and continue. The test for no diff is also much faster than a real diff. Improves processing time a lot for large test corpora. 2018-09-25T06:22:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved punctuation definitions from each language to giella-shared/all_langs/. Makes much more sense, and will help in resolving random tokenisation bugs due to « and ». 2018-09-13T08:33:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Implemented the option to compile phonology rules directly against the lexicon, for better rule compilation optimisations. Kevin: fixed a bug in xml generation for the grammar checker. 2018-09-11T07:16:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation build when there is no phonology file. 2018-09-10T11:49:24+00:00
< More general ignore pattern for tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. 2018-09-10T11:03:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected an error after the Hunspell config section was commented out. 2018-09-10T10:52:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added --enable-all-tools option to configure.ac, to allow for easier configuration and testing of all common tools. Unstable or experimental tools must still be explicitly enabled. Commented out the Hunspell speller config completely, it is not supported. Corrected a comment. 2018-09-10T09:49:35+00:00
< Updated svn ignore patterns. 2018-09-08T05:26:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved and completed the code to skip building phonology fst's. Clearer logic and comments. 2018-09-08T04:39:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure.ac setting to skip phonology compilation, typically used when compiling external sources, that provides a full analyser in src/morphology. Also added a configuration option to compile xfscript files with lexicon references in them, so allow for faster and more optimised rule composition. This variable has no effect yet, the rest of the machinery is missing. 2018-09-07T22:09:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Remove all tmp files when cleaning. 2018-09-06T11:43:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Remove also url.tmp.lexc when cleaning. 2018-09-06T11:36:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug: the url analyser is located elsewhere, and should not be processed here in any case. 2018-09-06T10:08:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Made url analyser compilation open for local adaptations, by going via a tmp file. 2018-09-06T07:31:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Remove also url.lexc when cleaning, it is copied from giella-shared. 2018-09-05T13:52:15+00:00
< xerox twolc happy with est-phon.twolc now, but analyser-raw-gt-desc.tmp.xfst.invert would not generate anything with +Par 2018-09-03T09:23:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected double installation of url analyser bug. It should not be installed at all. 2018-08-31T17:39:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Add missing ‘|’ in analyser-gt-whitespace.hfst goal. 2018-08-31T10:49:54+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2018-08-30T15:58:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the previous commit that surfaced when enabling tokenisers but not grammar checkers. 2018-08-30T13:36:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Massive rewrite of filter codes and automatically generated tag conversions, all done to handle bug #2474 (URL tag not correctly formatted in the tokeniser output). The bug should be fixed now. 2018-08-30T11:50:04+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2018-08-29T05:25:44+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter dir and filter compilation to the fst-based hyphenators. Moved filter compilation from src/filters/ to the local filter dir (by copying the regex files and then compile them), to make the build process mostly fst format independent. 2018-08-28T11:17:10+00:00
< Updating svn ignores. 2018-08-28T10:41:36+00:00
< lD nD rD mB rS changed to phonological assimilation-dissimilation, like the tradition is (from previous non-traditional llD nnD etc that treated them as a special case of orthographical convention); was kand+N:kannD1, now kand+N:kanD1 2018-08-27T13:48:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for local modifications of the hyphenator build via a tmp file. Simplified tmp file handling in the src/ dir. 2018-08-27T11:59:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added dir structure and Autotools data to prepare for adding hyphenation testing. 2018-08-27T10:55:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Downcasing of derived proper nouns was only applied on the input side, not the hyphenated side. This caused such words to be case-shifted: arabialaččat -> A^ra^bi^a^lač^čat. This is now fixed. 2018-08-27T07:48:39+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation bug where the lexicon-based hyphenator missed hyphenation points, mainly in propernouns, due to flag diacritics. Fixed by telling the fst compiler to treat flags as epsilons. Now the lexicon-based hyphenator is beating the plain rule-based one in most (all?) cases where there are differences. Must be tested better, though. 2018-08-26T16:53:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added comment to guide placement of local build targets (to avoid future merge conflicts), and a comment reminder about other places to change filenames. 2018-08-22T06:46:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised the source filenames to make it easy to override when needed. Should make it possible to solve the bug where src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3 overrides the same file in tools/grammarcheckers/. 2018-08-20T16:39:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Refactored repeating patterns of code with variables, fixes upload link after XServe crash last winter. 2018-08-20T09:55:48+00:00
< cleanup net added to xfst commands for Xerox build rules in makefile; attempted to make x_declinations.lexc more readable by re-grouping cont. lexicons 2018-06-15T14:53:27+00:00
< xerox lookup and hfst-lookup now give the same result 2018-06-12T08:58:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected and improved the compilation of the analysers including the URL analysis. This should fix the problem with compiling SMA and other languages, and should in general reduce both compilation time and analyser size. The basic change was to union in the URL analysis as the last step in building the analysers, instead of early - the early injection led to fst blowup during minimisation. Now no blowup appears to take place. 2018-06-05T12:07:51+00:00
< acronyms - up to 5 letter allcaps strings, can be inflected according to their pronounciation; likely overgenerating 2018-05-28T17:06:55+00:00
< acronyms.lexc added to svn 2018-05-28T06:58:35+00:00
< first attempt to handle acronyms 2018-05-25T17:58:25+00:00
< now the max number of hyphens that separate words is set to 2; 2018-05-21T16:16:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the special target .NOTPARALLEL to the hfst speller make file, to work around a make bug that caused a prerequisite to not be built when invoking make with the -j option. Also added some comments. 2018-05-18T13:00:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated command in comments to use the correct option. 2018-05-18T06:32:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Reverted the more robust semantic tag reordering, it was just too slow. Now we are back to a less robust and more fragile system (including bugs), but with faster compilation. Ultimately we will abandon _semantic_ tag reordering altogether, and instead rewrite the lexc code to always place the semantic tags where they should be. 2018-05-16T08:54:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected automake (and make?) syntax error that broke compilation. 2018-05-15T11:08:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Simplified semantic tag filtering regex construction. 2018-05-15T07:27:42+00:00
< More things to ignore. 2018-05-14T09:52:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Too eager in the previous commit to get rid of semantic tag processing: removed the filter to zero out semantic tags completely, which broke compilation of a number of fst's where semantic tags are not wanted. 2018-05-09T08:09:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected bugs in reordering semantic tags by doing the reordering in two steps: 1) insert the tag in the new and correct position, and 2) remove the tag in the wrong position. There will probably be things to iron out, but initial tests are fine. This should also make the whole semantic tag reordering a bit faster to compile and apply, as the generated regexes are smaller and simpler. 2018-05-08T17:53:29+00:00
< elamine-olemine corrected 2018-05-04T13:11:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now that the downcasing script works in all cases, remove all the special processing, and get rid of spurious rebuilds of the dependent fst's. Another time-saver:-) 2018-05-02T09:44:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the downcasing script to work also with hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Now the downcasing script works both with Xerox, Hfst and Foma, and both with standard and hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Finally! 2018-05-02T09:10:41+00:00
< Applying Tino’s Unicode fix to all other perl scripts in the src/scripts/ dir. 2018-04-26T19:48:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for filters for grammatical and derivation tags, sorted the generated filter list. 2018-04-23T14:45:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Bugfix: OLang/xxx tags were removed, not made optional, in generators. 2018-04-20T08:20:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Do not delete disambiguator.cg3 and grammarchecker.cg3 when cleaning. 2018-04-19T07:27:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Whether to let the orig-lang tags be visible in the disambiguating analyser or not is dependent on the language and the needs of each language community. Moving the removal of those tags from the general processing to the language specific processing. Step 2: removing it from the general processing. 2018-04-18T13:09:08+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the -p option to the yaml testing command, to remove all passing test. This should make it easier to spot the actual FAILs. 2018-03-08T12:46:47+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path to zhfst file. Also changed the return code when the zhfst file is not found, so that it will be reported as a FAIL. Since this test is only run when configured for building spellers, a missing zhfst file should be fatal. Also changed variable name to avoid confusion with the shell variable. 2018-03-08T10:55:45+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Made symbol alignment default - I can see no cases where we don't want it, but it is still possible to disable it if such a need pops up. Also improved the error message when trying to build a twolc language using Foma. 2018-02-09T08:00:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added INFO text about switching to Hfst as a fallback when Xerox tools are not found. Also added test and error message when using Foma on a language with a twolc file. 2018-02-09T07:11:09+00:00
< Two more files to ignore. 2018-02-06T09:34:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed URL analysis in MT. All URL's and email addresses are now tagged +URL. Although the url analyser itself is small, the resulting analyser quadrupled in size (in sme). 2018-02-05T19:44:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed filters for removing morphological borders - they destroy the assymetry of the fst's, and make yaml testing more complicated. 2018-02-02T08:10:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for Area variants of the grammar checker generator. Should fix nightly build error for SMJ. 2018-02-01T19:26:57+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Major rework of the yaml testing framework, to be able to properly support fst type specific yaml testing (ie test only xfst or hfst transducers, or everything but xfst transducers (=foma & hfst)). This change triggered a number of other changes. The user-facing shell scripts are greatly simplified by this change. 2018-02-01T09:56:08+00:00

< vowel plural less restricted now, and some twol rules fixed 2018-01-24T18:53:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added test for the presence of divvun-validate-suggest, which is now required to build grammar checkers. Now configure will error out instead of make. 2018-01-23T07:19:58+00:00
< compounding: pronouns, adverbs 2018-01-22T18:23:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Add note to the errors.xml file that it is generated, and from which file it is generated, to avoid people editing the wrong file. 2018-01-22T12:33:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Error messages are now copied from a source file to a build file, after bein validated. This allows support for VPATH builds and retains the integrity of the zcheck file. At the same time also replaced hard coded language names with automake variable expansion in the pipespec.xml.in file. 2018-01-22T10:24:51+00:00

< allcaps script now deployed in analysers 2018-01-18T16:03:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building dictionary analysers for alternative orthographies, introduced in the changes yesterday. 2018-01-18T07:04:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify language variant, to allow testing spellers for alternative writing systems, alternative orthographies, different countries etc. 2018-01-18T06:26:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for area / country specific fst's for the specialised dict and oahpa build files. At the same time reorganised the build code so that targets with two variables now consistently use the fst type / suffix as the pattern, and the writing system/alt orth/area/etc as the function parameter. This should make the build system more robust by reducing the risk for accidental pattern similarity. 2018-01-17T11:30:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building area/country specific spellers. The target language for now is SMJ, but the feature is of course language independent and useful in a number of other circumstances. 2018-01-16T19:31:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed dialect fst filenames to follow existing patterns used for Oahpa fst's. 2018-01-16T14:38:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building dialect fst's. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a configure option. Also changed the disamb analyser to keep the dialect tags. Only normative fst's are filtered against dialect tags. 2018-01-16T12:09:04+00:00
< uppercase for hyphenated words 2018-01-16T07:53:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for building Area-specific analysers and generators (norm only). Also restored Area tags in the disamb and grammar checker analysers. Fixed missing support for Foma transducers in the alternative writing system support. 2018-01-16T07:33:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Grammar checker .zcheck file should go into datadir, not libdir. 2018-01-15T11:33:44+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now using speller version info from configure.ac, not version.txt, which is removed. New giella-core required. 2018-01-15T09:56:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in fst format handling for the grammar checker - conflicting formats caused a segfault. Now using openfst-tropical for all fst's being processed in the grammarcheckers/ dir (presently only the speller acceptor analyser). 2018-01-15T08:44:53+00:00
< minor changes in compounding 2018-01-12T19:47:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed OLang tag extraction and filter generation. 2018-01-12T13:13:04+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added weights to compounds in the language-indpendent build steps (languages without compounds will go through the same step, but will not be changed). Applied only to analysers. Also added spellrelax to the language-independent build of the analysers = it it always applied. 2018-01-12T11:53:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the previous fix: make sure it does not crash when the target file does not exist, and use the same test on all autogenerated tag lists. This should save a few more seconds of build time. 2018-01-12T08:28:10+00:00
< minor improvements in compounding 2018-01-11T18:47:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug #2355 so that the filters for semantic tags will only be rebuilt when there are real changes to the semantic tags. 2018-01-11T17:12:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a € vs cut incompatibility on Linux, cf bug report #2457. 2018-01-11T08:40:19+00:00
< compounding hopefully better now (work on Helsinki-Tallinn boat) 2018-01-10T14:50:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated the pipespec.xml file to comply with the newest version of the grammar checker code, where each argument type is explicitly specified. Makes for a more robust pipeline. 2018-01-10T11:59:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected fileref in m4, added correct autoconf path to errors.xml. 2018-01-08T14:42:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed pipespec.xml to *.in, to allow autoconf processing. This makes it possible to use modes when building using VPATHS/out-of-source builds. 2018-01-08T14:20:23+00:00
< here, 'ei' got Adv analysis, thus quoting it instead. 2018-01-08T10:33:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Hard-coded filename in fallback target - that was the only way to work around a loop in make on some systems. 2018-01-08T09:42:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/disambiguation.cg3 to src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3, to keep the file naming consistent (actor noun if possible), and remove discrepancy between the regular disambiguator and the grammar checker disambiguator that caused makefile troubles. 2018-01-08T05:50:37+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Heavy rewrite of the analysis regression check tool, to support testing the grammar checker pipeline. 2017-12-12T11:44:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove semantic tags, dialect tags and other tags useful for disambiguation or suggestion generation. The grammar checker speller needs these, and they will anyway disappear when we project the final fst. 2017-12-11T13:03:01+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2017-12-11T12:51:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Proper verbosity specification in a few more instances, and added weight pushing for the grammar checker speller now (how could I have missed that?). 2017-12-01T12:23:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in piped hfst-xfst commands: in three cases the -p option was missing, causing strange misbehavior in hfst-xfst on some systems. 2017-12-01T11:58:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further configure.ac cleanup: moved some variable definitions to other m4 files, moved the language definition on top, deprecated GTLANG* variables for GLANG* variants (ie Giella instead of GiellaTechno). Updated copyright year. 2017-12-01T10:10:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved all default AC_CONFIG_FILES into a separate function in a separate m4 file, to clean up configure.ac. Some other cleanup of configure.ac. 2017-12-01T09:18:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Defined variable for separate speller release version string. 2017-12-01T08:18:29+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated comment in preparation for other changes. 2017-12-01T07:47:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for analysing whitespace and thus make it possible to tag whitespace errors (double spaces, extra spaces, etc), and also to more reliably detect sentence and paragraph borders by using whitespace as a delimiter. 2017-11-30T14:07:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Using absolute dir refs to make it possible to call the shell scripts from everywhere. 2017-11-30T12:31:01+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the speller test scripts in devtools/ to be VPATH safe and rely on autotools for paths etc, so that the scripts will work also when only checking out single languages. 2017-11-29T12:09:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying language-specific files to be included in the grammar checker archive file. 2017-11-15T13:17:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated grammar checker files and build rules. 2017-11-13T09:38:05+00:00
< compounding is more restrictive now, and it fails to recognize many legitimate compounds also... 2017-11-09T17:21:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added hfst-push-weights to move transducer weights to the beginning of the strings, to enable proper optimisations of speller lookup in hfst-ospell. Stripped out most lang-specific stuff from grammar checker cg file, and added simple example rules + some explanations. Use gramcheck tokeniser in pre-pipe. 2017-11-07T15:44:23+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added spell checking component to the grammar checker pipeline. Now every planned component is working as it should. The spell checking requires first that one builds the latest hfst-ospell code, and then the newest grammar checker code for this to work. 2017-10-24T12:48:15+00:00
< docu 2017-10-16T15:33:39+00:00

< some corrections for words that have parallel forms 2017-10-11T18:03:06+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] One misplaced variable caused the grammar checker speller to be built independent of the configuration. This caused a build fail for everyone. Solves bug #2437. Also added $(srcdir) in front of root.lexc, to ensure that the file reference resolves correctly in local build targets. 2017-10-10T09:23:22+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Major update to the grammar checker template. It still does not work completely as it should, so hold your horses. Update content: ensured that all files needed are copied to the grammar checker build dir, removed option to name files (=irrelevant bloat), now builds an almost proper zip file, and ensured that tokenisers are built before grammarcheckers. Also made it so that when grammar checkers are enabled, spellers are automatically enabled too, as they will be included as part of the grammar checker pipeline. 2017-10-03T06:50:59+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] After a couple of bug fixes in giella-core, require the new version. 2017-08-25T09:58:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building tokenisers where the morphological analysis tags are given in CG format directly instead of having to be postprocess by hfst-tokenise before being printed. The idea is to make the hfst-tokenise code more general, and move everything that is particular to one language or setup go into the fst instead of being hardcoded in the C++ code. There are some issues that must be resolved, but fst-wise the code works. 2017-08-24T11:33:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building a regex that transform all tags from the format "+Adv" to " Adv" (including space). The idea is to make the tags readily consumable by CG. Both prefix and suffix tags are converted. Newest giella-core required. 2017-08-24T10:02:20+00:00

< second try for emb-kumb et al; makefile.am still not ok 2017-05-17T17:59:11+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed Ins() around Unknown. This triggered a bug(?) in hfst-tokenise, that caused wordforms not to be output. Speed and memory consumption should not be noticably affected. 2017-05-16T16:59:19+00:00
< first version that handles paired words (emb-kumb, kihin-kahin) that inflect both (emma-kumma, kihina-kahina); it is done by concatenating nets and applying filters 2017-05-12T18:04:34+00:00
< slightly tightened control of derivational suffix sequences 2017-05-05T07:58:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved pmatch scripts - unification by reference instead of full fst unification. Reduces file size by ≈2/3, and runtime memory consumption by 50%. 2017-05-04T10:18:16+00:00
< slightly more constraining derivation filter 2017-05-02T12:28:52+00:00
< helveetslane OK 2017-05-02T08:17:25+00:00
< firenzelane (lower cased) is now accepted 2017-04-28T18:11:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now that there is a new version of Hfst out, require it. Should resolve issues with compiling the url.lexc file. 2017-04-18T15:19:10+00:00
< derivations improved, and added proper nouns to deriv. bases, but downcasing them not done yet. I.e. Pariislane is accepted... 2017-04-07T18:06:02+00:00
< removed the gi-particle possibility from some adverbs that end with gi/ki already 2017-04-05T16:11:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further development of the analysis regression check: added support for diff views of all diff types, and now you can specify which diff view you want to see (and you must specify at least one). You can also override the default corpus, and specify a corpus of your own with the -c/--corpus option. Also corrected the initial description of the script in the help text, and added a diff view comparing the old pipeline using Xerox with the new pipeline using hfst-tokenise. This will help in finding unwanted differences between the two. 2017-03-17T12:44:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further improvements to the analysis regression check: only do function and dependency analysis if the required cg3 files exist. Also clarified the -d option and silenced the Xerox lookup tool. 2017-03-16T14:33:20+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved analysis regression check script: added a short help text, and added an option to ask for a diff between old-style (preprocess+lookup+lookup2cg) and new-style (hfst-tokenise+mwe-disamb+cg-mwesplit) morphological analysis. Intended to be used to find weak (and strong!) spots in the new-style morphological analysis. 2017-03-16T12:17:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the first version of a $LANG/devtools/ script that will process a corpus with the available tools, and compare the result against the previous version in the svn repository. The idea is to be able to easily spot regressions in analyses due to changes in the lexicons or CG rules. There are a number of rough edges, but it works. 2017-03-16T10:03:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Only remove generated lemma files if the lemma generation tests succeeds. 2017-03-14T14:05:45+00:00
< undo jaska's accidental last commit 2017-03-13T13:00:43+00:00
< Work with CnsInZero, VowInZero to improve xfst. 2017-03-13T07:53:18+00:00
< a couple pronoun forms corrected 2017-03-10T20:42:09+00:00
< tale (pro talle) corrected; adjectives that form comparative degree irregularly (soe, pikk etc) now not allowed to form it via derivation; derived comp and superl adjectives are now inflected in fin->est also (thanks to tag conversion) 2017-03-08T18:48:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Only delete generated dic and tex files if one really wants to start anew. Do not delete the version.txt file, only the generated wordlist file. 2017-03-07T18:45:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Add the url parser also to the grammar checker tokeniser. 2017-03-07T15:00:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make the url.hfst a dependent of the hfst tokenising analyser. Improved the tokeniser based on recent changes in sme. 2017-03-06T17:06:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed automatic inclusion of the url parsing fst. The union with the regular fst blew up the total, in some cases more than 10x! The preferred way of adding it is to add it in the last steps of the *.tmp.fst > *.fst processing by loading it onto the stack (and inverse it for hfst) before saving the fst stack, and thus creating a transducer file with two fst's. Applying the input to them both will in effect union them, giving the output we want without blowing up the size of the fst file. 2017-03-03T14:13:08+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for compiling a lexc file for parsing URL's as such, giving them a separate tag. Only added to the descriptive analysers for now. Requires an updated version of giella-shared, due to the new file needed for the new functionality. 2017-03-02T14:04:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrects an inconsistency in the order of tag changing processing, where generators and analysers got their tags changed in different order, which caused different tags in some cases. Fixes bug #2264. Thanks to Heiki-Jaan Kaalep for the new and corrected code. 2017-03-02T06:35:58+00:00
< deleted (for now) punctuation tag conversion in a filter so that now punctuation passes through Apertium without errors 2017-03-01T14:47:38+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2017-03-01T11:26:04+00:00
< twolc documentation (not sure it is worth doing...) and a change in apertium lexicon building script: changed the order in which modify-tags.regex and apertium.postproc.relabel are applied in analyser. as a result, modify-tags behaves in a more symmetrical way. 2017-02-28T19:29:05+00:00
< The yaml tests are passing for Heiki-Jaan and me (at least), thus remove the test runner from the XFAIL list to easier detect regressions. 2017-02-28T07:13:21+00:00
< adding modify-tags.regex 2017-02-27T11:55:31+00:00
< script for testing 2017-02-27T09:37:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated Python feedback to correctly state that Python 3.5 is required. 2017-02-27T09:21:02+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Increased reqiured version of Python3, due to the updated speller test bench. 2017-02-15T07:57:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] New version of the speller test bench, now with sortable table columns, and optional timing of the suggestions for every input word (hfst-ospell-office only). Not finished, but working quite well. It is also possible now to specify the number of suggestions returned by hfst-ospell-office. 2017-02-14T09:37:59+00:00
< Der/lik 2017-02-13T20:50:17+00:00

< derivations do not generate multiple paths any more, but the filters to weed out incorrect ones are still not working properly 2017-02-07T18:54:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Increased required version of giella-core due to bug fix in the core. 2017-02-03T11:46:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Increased required version of giella-core due to changes in speller building. 2017-02-03T09:45:31+00:00
< derivation filter that disallows some derivations, based on word class, works now 2017-02-02T17:21:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] One more attempt at fixing the giella-common package bug. 2017-02-02T08:46:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added final step in building pattern-based hyphenators: now also prepared for Hunspell-like OOo hyphenation. Requires new version of the giella-core. Also corrected bug in checking the version number of giella-common. 2017-02-01T11:03:20+00:00
< first version of derivation 2017-01-31T20:01:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Tex pattern based hyphenation generation works. The output must be checked and tested, and the process may have to be rerun several times to get the desired hyphenation behavior. Removed outcommented build code from the old infra - the new build code is essentially just a reformulation of the old one. 2017-01-31T14:37:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for checking the version of the giella-common package (aka giella-shared/). Added two new regexes to the source file list for shared regexes. Updated the required version of Hfst - it has not been updated in ages. 2017-01-31T13:46:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further work on the pattern based hyphenators: added tra file template, which is used to 'translate'  non-ASCII chars to ascii only for the pattern creation process. Initial build steps for the pattern build. 2017-01-31T12:15:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the fst-based hyphenator by removing irrelevant paths from the fst. Started work on the pattern-based hyphenator, based on code from the old infra. 2017-01-31T10:17:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Finished first version of fst-based hyphenator: now includes plain rules as a fall-back solution (including for misspelled words), and Err-tagged forms get a high weight penalty. In general, this seems to give good hyphenation patterns if one pick the first (lowest-weight) one. 2017-01-30T13:47:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First version of lexicon-based and fst-based hyphenation done. Works, but misses capitalised words, and does not give extra weights to Err-tagged word forms. Also no hyphenation of misspelled words yet. Hyphenation builds are off by default. 2017-01-30T12:08:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added template file for weighting tags when the fst is used as a hyphenator. 2017-01-30T10:28:43+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2017-01-30T09:54:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added check for cg-relabel when enabling apertium. Thanks to Flammie for identifying the issue. 2017-01-30T09:19:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added basic dir structure for building hyphenators. 2017-01-27T07:14:28+00:00
< Replaced gtcore with giella-core. 2017-01-25T10:39:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced gtcore with giella-core. 2017-01-25T09:38:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added test dir for hyphenators, to store data from the old infra. 2017-01-23T10:48:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added test dirs for listbased spellcheckers, if we ever get to that. 2017-01-23T09:03:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed logical error in the handling of negated specified fst handling in yaml tests (e.g. ~xfst) - the test didn't work, and the yaml file was run when not intended. 2017-01-18T00:26:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed regression introduced in the previous commit: one-sided tests where included when looking for test data, causing a subsequent python fail when no actual test data was found. Fixed by using a stricter file name pattern. 2017-01-17T15:51:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify in a yaml filename that it should only be tested against a specific technology or not, by specifying one of .foma, .hfst or .xfst before the suffix part (before [.gen].yaml), and prefixed with '~' if negated (i.e. .~xfst for NOT running it against Xerox). 2017-01-17T08:25:53+00:00
< Corrected the Links.jspwiki file - for some reason, Heiki-Jaan’s system generates a garbled Links file (cf commit 146727). 2017-01-16T21:23:26+00:00
< added a script sceleton for Heli to remove usage tags from certain wordforms 2017-01-16T19:23:27+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Slightly more robust yaml testing code. 2017-01-16T15:14:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Common starting point for both weighted and unweighted parts. 2017-01-16T15:06:42+00:00

< Worked with Heikki-Jaan to solve an issue with generating documentation: if a document is listed as a target, but the corresponding lexc file has _no_ line containing documenting comments, AWK will fail, and the build will error out. 2016-12-02T09:11:57+00:00

< stem illative and sse illative for PERE type corrected 2016-11-28T21:20:20+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the bash hack to add a css processing instruction - it is done by the perl script writing the xml file. 2016-11-28T19:45:47+00:00
< vowel lowering is now handled in a more genral way in twolc; and plural partitive for sai and other i-ending words of type PIIM works now 2016-11-24T18:22:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the removal for dialect and variant tags from the grammar checker analyser, the information can be useful when generating suggestions for corrections. 2016-11-23T14:45:29+00:00
< voodeid now ok, but other cases of vowel lowering need re-thinking to make est-phon look nice 2016-11-23T09:37:27+00:00
< regular_declinations a bit simplified now 2016-11-23T08:33:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed repetition of the frequency weighted fst. The goal was to promote compounds where each part was already seen in the corpus, but it made the speller bigger and slower, and actually decreased suggestion quality slightly. — Also added code to do manual priority union, but it is buggy and outcommented for now. 2016-11-21T08:14:21+00:00
< updated docu. 2016-11-19T10:55:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added info about which file to look in to find a suitable frequency corpus cut-off location (=line number). 2016-11-18T09:26:11+00:00
< created cont.lexicons for case names in ..._declinations.lexc; they should be useful for compounding 2016-11-17T19:48:43+00:00
---
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter to remove the +MWE tag from the grammar checker generator. It blocked generation of some word forms (and should not be visible in any case). 2019-02-13T07:47:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed another case of transducer format mismatch for hyphenators, this time regarding pattern-based hyph building. 2019-01-25T08:54:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected an instance of transducer format mismatch when building hyphenators. 2019-01-25T08:08:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make the mobile keyboard layout error model work properly (ie on input  longer than one char) by circumfixing it with any-stars. 2019-01-17T20:23:10+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First round of improved handling of compilation errors in shell pipes: instruct make to delete targets when some of the intermediate steps fail. 2019-01-11T13:53:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure.ac conditional to control whether spellers for alternative orthographies are built. The default is 'true'. Set this to 'false' for historical or other orthographies for which a speller is not relevant. 2019-01-09T10:41:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fix broken hfst builds of xfscript files when there is no final newline in the source file (caused the save command to be shaddowed by the final line of text, usually a comment, so no file was saved, and thus there was nothing to work on for the next build step). 2019-01-09T08:59:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Apply alternate orthography conversion after hyphenation marks have been removed, but before the morphology marks are deleted. Especially word boundaries are useful for certain types of conversion, but other borders will likely be useful as well. The conversion scripts need to take the border marks into consideration. 2019-01-08T08:59:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replicate the desktop error model for the mobile speller, and generalise the corpus weighting compilation. Now the build code is ready for mobile speller release. 2018-12-17T17:45:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved Easter egg generation, using the improved script in giella-core. Increased the required giella-core version correspondingly. 2018-12-14T09:21:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Cleaned the HFST_MINIMIZE_SPELLER macro, and also its use. No need to include push weights anymore, it is done always, for all speller fst's. 2018-12-13T10:22:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Push weights for all final fst's, + optimise error model. 2018-12-13T09:57:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed how the att file is produced. From now on it should be built once, and then added to svn. The att file will usually not change, and storing it in svn will avoid rebuilding it every time. Also changed the compression. 2018-12-12T14:55:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for adapting the error model to the mobile keyboard layout for the language in question. 2018-12-11T14:27:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Two more places to remove the Use/-GC and the MWE tags: mt and speller fst's. Now done. 2018-11-06T07:54:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Had forgotten to remove the Use/-GC tag in the core fst's, only from all the others. Now fixed. 2018-11-05T15:57:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Step 2 in blocking dynamic compounds of MWE tagged entries: moved all MWE tag processing away from the *-raw-* targets to the specific *.tmp targets. This way the MWE tags will survive long enough to be available for the blocking done in the tokeniser fst's. Tested in SME, and seems to work as intended. 2018-11-05T09:10:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added step 1 in blocking dynamic comounds between an MWE and another noun: added new filter that will turn the MWE tag into a flag diacritic. Increased required giella-common version number due to the new filter. 2018-11-02T11:16:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug when building the punctuation file - the required subdir was not made. 2018-10-24T08:39:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the whitespace analyser almost to the beginning of the pipeline, directly after the tokeniser+analyser. This is to be able to support sentence boundary detection, as the whitespace analyser will give some valuable tags for that. 2018-10-12T14:07:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in a configuration option - dekstop instead of desktop. Thanks to our friends in Nuuk for noticing. 2018-10-11T15:55:10+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a misplaced dependency that caused url.hfst to be rebuilt on every make, and thus trigger other rebuilds. Not anymore. 2018-10-09T14:42:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace tagging after the speller, to avoid that it creates trouble for the speller. That happens when whitespace error tags are applied to the word form that should be spell-checked. 2018-10-09T14:08:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made it possible to tag something as _only_ for the grammar checker, or _not_ for the grammar checker. Updated required giella-share version, due to new required filters. 2018-10-09T11:50:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved whitespace chars to the blank regex, thereby reinstating the old compilation speed. Thanks to Kevin and Tino for noticing and suggesting the improvement. Also added comment to document what incondform is supposed to contain, again thanks to Kevin. 2018-10-09T10:08:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed hyphen from the regular unknown alphabet, thereby reverting analysis of -foo as one (unknown) token, and instead back to two tokens. Added hyphen to alphamiddle, so that foo-bar will still be analysed as one big unknown token. 2018-10-09T08:58:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the tokenisation disambigutation file to the compiled and installed targets. 2018-10-09T07:31:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of unknowns: defined more whitespace characters, defined a lot more vowels in the alphabet, added recent improvements to flag diacritic like symbols at token boundaries. 2018-10-08T20:49:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed two build bugs: abbr.txt was only autogenerated when building with hfst, and the url.?fst file was not properly generated from url.tmp.?fst. 2018-10-04T11:04:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in MT compilation - pattern rules are not used, but new filenames still had them due to copy-paste error. 2018-10-04T08:43:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering also to MT and spellcheckers. Now all tools and fst's should be covered. 2018-10-04T07:59:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to add pmatch filtering to the default targets in src/ - duh. Now done. 2018-10-04T07:32:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pmatch filtering to the rest of the build targets in src/. Also added grammar checker filtering. 2018-10-03T10:42:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to properly handle pmatch preparations, by splitting the disamb-analyser compilation in two: one going to the regular disamb analyser, and the other going to the pmatch variant. We use the two tags +Use/PMatch and +Use/-Pmatch in complementary distribution to specify paths for each, one path containing pmatch backtracking poings (used with the --giella format of hfst-tokenise), and one without. The backtracking machinery is used to handle ambiguous tokenisation. Increased required version of giella-shared due to new, required filters. 2018-10-03T07:47:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More improvements to the analysis regression check: undo space->underscore from lookup2cg (to avoid meaningless diffs when comparing to the new hfst-tokenise), and removed weight info. Also changed the dir ref for abbr.txt to ref the build dir, not the source dir, as that is where the file is generated. 2018-10-01T09:57:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved regression check script: check that the abbr file is built, for improved traditional tokenisation; and make the patch command silent, for less noise during testing. 2018-09-29T12:13:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Thanks to Børre, the analysis regression script will now remove diffs due to different handling of dynamic compounds when comparing old and new tokenisation. This makes it much easier to spot real differences between the two. 2018-09-25T10:10:13+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved shell script for analysis regression testing, so that in cases of no diffs it will only print a short message and continue. The test for no diff is also much faster than a real diff. Improves processing time a lot for large test corpora. 2018-09-25T06:57:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved punctuation definitions from each language to giella-shared/all_langs/. Makes much more sense, and will help in resolving random tokenisation bugs due to « and ». 2018-09-13T11:01:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Implemented the option to compile phonology rules directly against the lexicon, for better rule compilation optimisations. Kevin: fixed a bug in xml generation for the grammar checker. 2018-09-11T07:15:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation build when there is no phonology file. 2018-09-10T11:52:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected an error after the Hunspell config section was commented out. 2018-09-10T10:56:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added --enable-all-tools option to configure.ac, to allow for easier configuration and testing of all common tools. Unstable or experimental tools must still be explicitly enabled. Commented out the Hunspell speller config completely, it is not supported. Corrected a comment. 2018-09-10T10:35:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved and completed the code to skip building phonology fst's. Clearer logic and comments. 2018-09-08T04:50:27+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure.ac setting to skip phonology compilation, typically used when compiling external sources, that provides a full analyser in src/morphology. Also added a configuration option to compile xfscript files with lexicon references in them, so allow for faster and more optimised rule composition. This variable has no effect yet, the rest of the machinery is missing. 2018-09-07T22:39:32+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Remove all tmp files when cleaning. 2018-09-06T11:43:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Remove also url.tmp.lexc when cleaning. 2018-09-06T11:36:46+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug: the url analyser is located elsewhere, and should not be processed here in any case. 2018-09-06T10:09:11+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made url analyser compilation open for local adaptations, by going via a tmp file. 2018-09-06T07:32:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Remove also url.lexc when cleaning, it is copied from giella-shared. 2018-09-05T13:52:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected double installation of url analyser bug. It should not be installed at all. 2018-08-31T17:48:19+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Add missing ‘|’ in analyser-gt-whitespace.hfst goal. 2018-08-31T11:04:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the previous commit that surfaced when enabling tokenisers but not grammar checkers. 2018-08-30T14:09:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Massive rewrite of filter codes and automatically generated tag conversions, all done to handle bug #2474 (URL tag not correctly formatted in the tokeniser output). The bug should be fixed now. 2018-08-30T12:47:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter dir and filter compilation to the fst-based hyphenators. Moved filter compilation from src/filters/ to the local filter dir (by copying the regex files and then compile them), to make the build process mostly fst format independent. 2018-08-28T11:48:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for local modifications of the hyphenator build via a tmp file. Simplified tmp file handling in the src/ dir. 2018-08-27T12:21:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added dir structure and Autotools data to prepare for adding hyphenation testing. 2018-08-27T10:57:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Downcasing of derived proper nouns was only applied on the input side, not the hyphenated side. This caused such words to be case-shifted: arabialaččat -> A^ra^bi^a^lač^čat. This is now fixed. 2018-08-27T07:54:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed hyphenation bug where the lexicon-based hyphenator missed hyphenation points, mainly in propernouns, due to flag diacritics. Fixed by telling the fst compiler to treat flags as epsilons. Now the lexicon-based hyphenator is beating the plain rule-based one in most (all?) cases where there are differences. Must be tested better, though. 2018-08-26T17:13:32+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added comment to guide placement of local build targets (to avoid future merge conflicts), and a comment reminder about other places to change filenames. 2018-08-22T06:50:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reorganised the source filenames to make it easy to override when needed. Should make it possible to solve the bug where src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3 overrides the same file in tools/grammarcheckers/. 2018-08-21T12:45:04+00:00
> Reverting all */tools/grammarcheckers/Makefile.am to rev 160158 by using this command in langs/: 2018-08-21T12:28:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Refactored repeating patterns of code with variables, fixes upload link after XServe crash last winter. 2018-08-20T10:01:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected and improved the compilation of the analysers including the URL analysis. This should fix the problem with compiling SMA and other languages, and should in general reduce both compilation time and analyser size. The basic change was to union in the URL analysis as the last step in building the analysers, instead of early - the early injection led to fst blowup during minimisation. Now no blowup appears to take place. 2018-06-05T12:25:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the special target .NOTPARALLEL to the hfst speller make file, to work around a make bug that caused a prerequisite to not be built when invoking make with the -j option. Also added some comments. 2018-05-18T13:00:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated command in comments to use the correct option. 2018-05-18T06:43:53+00:00
> Output in a more readable format 2018-05-16T11:21:04+00:00
> Cleaned up taglistings 2018-05-16T10:55:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Reverted the more robust semantic tag reordering, it was just too slow. Now we are back to a less robust and more fragile system (including bugs), but with faster compilation. Ultimately we will abandon _semantic_ tag reordering altogether, and instead rewrite the lexc code to always place the semantic tags where they should be. 2018-05-16T09:08:46+00:00
> Skip outcommented lines in .lexc and the resultings tags 2018-05-15T17:46:36+00:00
> First iteration of tags found 2018-05-15T17:31:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected automake (and make?) syntax error that broke compilation. 2018-05-15T11:09:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Simplified semantic tag filtering regex construction. 2018-05-15T07:32:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Too eager in the previous commit to get rid of semantic tag processing: removed the filter to zero out semantic tags completely, which broke compilation of a number of fst's where semantic tags are not wanted. 2018-05-09T08:15:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected bugs in reordering semantic tags by doing the reordering in two steps: 1) insert the tag in the new and correct position, and 2) remove the tag in the wrong position. There will probably be things to iron out, but initial tests are fine. This should also make the whole semantic tag reordering a bit faster to compile and apply, as the generated regexes are smaller and simpler. 2018-05-08T18:26:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now that the downcasing script works in all cases, remove all the special processing, and get rid of spurious rebuilds of the dependent fst's. Another time-saver:-) 2018-05-02T10:13:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the downcasing script to work also with hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Now the downcasing script works both with Xerox, Hfst and Foma, and both with standard and hyperminimised hfst-fst's. Finally! 2018-05-02T09:13:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for filters for grammatical and derivation tags, sorted the generated filter list. 2018-04-23T14:46:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Bugfix: OLang/xxx tags were removed, not made optional, in generators. 2018-04-20T08:32:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not delete disambiguator.cg3 and grammarchecker.cg3 when cleaning. 2018-04-19T08:49:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Whether to let the orig-lang tags be visible in the disambiguating analyser or not is dependent on the language and the needs of each language community. Moving the removal of those tags from the general processing to the language specific processing. Step 2: removing it from the general processing. 2018-04-18T13:16:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the -p option to the yaml testing command, to remove all passing test. This should make it easier to spot the actual FAILs. 2018-03-08T12:52:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path to zhfst file. Also changed the return code when the zhfst file is not found, so that it will be reported as a FAIL. Since this test is only run when configured for building spellers, a missing zhfst file should be fatal. Also changed variable name to avoid confusion with the shell variable. 2018-03-08T11:02:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added phony target forwarding 'make test' to 'make check'. Required to make 'make check' work on some build systems. 2018-03-08T10:41:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a separate disambiguation file for the spell checker output, and a spell-checker-only pipeline (well, still tokenisation and disambigation, but no proper grammar checking). 2018-03-05T15:40:34+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected Foma compilation for phonology rules. 2018-03-05T10:23:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made symbol alignment default - I can see no cases where we don't want it, but it is still possible to disable it if such a need pops up. Also improved the error message when trying to build a twolc language using Foma. 2018-02-09T08:08:15+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added INFO text about switching to Hfst as a fallback when Xerox tools are not found. Also added test and error message when using Foma on a language with a twolc file. 2018-02-09T07:36:31+00:00
> Just for completeness and symetry: added foma target. 2018-02-06T07:19:25+00:00
> Another attempt at getting rid of the nightly build fails: reverting back to exactly as it was before my first change, with one modification (and one modification only): added $(HFST_FORMAT) to allow speed optimisations using the foma backend. 2018-02-06T07:16:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed URL analysis in MT. All URL's and email addresses are now tagged +URL. Although the url analyser itself is small, the resulting analyser quadrupled in size (in sme). 2018-02-05T19:49:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed filters for removing morphological borders - they destroy the assymetry of the fst's, and make yaml testing more complicated. 2018-02-02T08:12:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for Area variants of the grammar checker generator. Should fix nightly build error for SMJ. 2018-02-01T19:32:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added missing Foma support for dictionary fst's. 2018-02-01T18:40:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed the last bunch of path errors. Now all yaml tests are back to normal. 2018-02-01T17:50:32+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Cleanup: commented in outcommented test loop, removed exit statement used during development, fixed path for two test scripts. 2018-02-01T15:59:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] The last set of test runners for yaml tests changed to the new system. 2018-02-01T15:15:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Three more yaml test runners done, still a few more to go before yaml testing is back in shape. 2018-02-01T13:58:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the last yaml testing scripts in the template to follow the new and improved system. No need for autoconf processing anymore. 2018-02-01T12:11:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major rework of the yaml testing framework, to be able to properly support fst type specific yaml testing (ie test only xfst or hfst transducers, or everything but xfst transducers (=foma & hfst)). This change triggered a number of other changes. The user-facing shell scripts are greatly simplified by this change. 2018-02-01T09:56:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected AM errors in the previous merge. Now the build is working again, 2018-01-31T11:42:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for grammar checker generators for alternative orthographies and writing systems. Should fix nightly build issue in CRK. 2018-01-31T11:14:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for a grammar checker specific generator. Should fix various issues re generation of suggestions. 2018-01-25T09:40:03+00:00
> Thanks to Heiki-Jaan for spotting a copy-paste error on my part. 2018-01-25T08:57:42+00:00
> Still an error in the nightly build. I am not able to reproduce the error, but I change back to having the regex on one line only, no escaped linebreaks in the Makefile. This is how it was earlier,  and that seemed to work. No idea why that would make a difference, though. 2018-01-25T07:49:03+00:00
> Fixed jspwiki error in the documentation. 2018-01-24T09:11:20+00:00
> Updated docu. 2018-01-24T08:14:44+00:00
> More and better documentation. 2018-01-24T08:14:13+00:00
> Removed the '7 definition, no need for it. Defined all escaped quotes and brackets as realised as themselves, to fit with the general handling of morphological boundaries, and to get rid of warnings of multichar only found on one fst during composition-intersection. 2018-01-24T08:08:01+00:00
> Removed the '7 definition, no need for it. Defined all escaped quotes and brackets, to get rid of warnings of multichar only found on one fst during composition-intersection. 2018-01-24T08:05:51+00:00
> Giella style whitespace changes. '7 was changed to plain ', as there is no need for the special use of it in est (and it is in fact not used). 2018-01-24T08:03:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added test for the presence of divvun-validate-suggest, which is now required to build grammar checkers. Now configure will error out instead of make. 2018-01-23T07:34:53+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Add note to the errors.xml file that it is generated, and from which file it is generated, to avoid people editing the wrong file. 2018-01-22T12:42:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Error messages are now copied from a source file to a build file, after bein validated. This allows support for VPATH builds and retains the integrity of the zcheck file. At the same time also replaced hard coded language names with automake variable expansion in the pipespec.xml.in file. 2018-01-22T10:59:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building dictionary analysers for alternative orthographies, introduced in the changes yesterday. 2018-01-18T07:10:31+00:00
> Trying to fix broken nightly build by swithing to semicolon separated regex, after I added whitespace to make the regexes more readable. 2018-01-18T06:47:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify language variant, to allow testing spellers for alternative writing systems, alternative orthographies, different countries etc. 2018-01-18T06:35:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for area / country specific fst's for the specialised dict and oahpa build files. At the same time reorganised the build code so that targets with two variables now consistently use the fst type / suffix as the pattern, and the writing system/alt orth/area/etc as the function parameter. This should make the build system more robust by reducing the risk for accidental pattern similarity. 2018-01-17T11:37:42+00:00
> Fixed build errors due to fst format mismatch. Now builds properly with Hfst again. The morpher takes ages, and should probably not be built for est. 2018-01-17T07:56:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building area/country specific spellers. The target language for now is SMJ, but the feature is of course language independent and useful in a number of other circumstances. 2018-01-16T19:48:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed dialect fst filenames to follow existing patterns used for Oahpa fst's. 2018-01-16T14:42:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building dialect fst's. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a configure option. Also changed the disamb analyser to keep the dialect tags. Only normative fst's are filtered against dialect tags. 2018-01-16T12:39:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for building Area-specific analysers and generators (norm only). Also restored Area tags in the disamb and grammar checker analysers. Fixed missing support for Foma transducers in the alternative writing system support. 2018-01-16T07:44:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Grammar checker .zcheck file should go into datadir, not libdir. 2018-01-15T11:55:49+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now using speller version info from configure.ac, not version.txt, which is removed. New giella-core required. 2018-01-15T10:40:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in fst format handling for the grammar checker - conflicting formats caused a segfault. Now using openfst-tropical for all fst's being processed in the grammarcheckers/ dir (presently only the speller acceptor analyser). 2018-01-15T08:51:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed OLang tag extraction and filter generation. 2018-01-12T13:19:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added weights to compounds in the language-indpendent build steps (languages without compounds will go through the same step, but will not be changed). Applied only to analysers. Also added spellrelax to the language-independent build of the analysers = it it always applied. 2018-01-12T11:58:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the previous fix: make sure it does not crash when the target file does not exist, and use the same test on all autogenerated tag lists. This should save a few more seconds of build time. 2018-01-12T08:33:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug #2355 so that the filters for semantic tags will only be rebuilt when there are real changes to the semantic tags. 2018-01-11T17:28:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a € vs cut incompatibility on Linux, cf bug report #2457. 2018-01-11T08:49:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated the pipespec.xml file to comply with the newest version of the grammar checker code, where each argument type is explicitly specified. Makes for a more robust pipeline. 2018-01-10T12:05:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected fileref in m4, added correct autoconf path to errors.xml. 2018-01-08T14:48:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed pipespec.xml to *.in, to allow autoconf processing. This makes it possible to use modes when building using VPATHS/out-of-source builds. 2018-01-08T14:23:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Hard-coded filename in fallback target - that was the only way to work around a loop in make on some systems. 2018-01-08T09:46:56+00:00
> em dash (sigh). Thanks to Sjur for spotting the obvious. 2018-01-08T07:37:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed src/syntax/disambiguation.cg3 to src/syntax/disambiguator.cg3, to keep the file naming consistent (actor noun if possible), and remove discrepancy between the regular disambiguator and the grammar checker disambiguator that caused makefile troubles. 2018-01-07T16:41:02+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove semantic tags, dialect tags and other tags useful for disambiguation or suggestion generation. The grammar checker speller needs these, and they will anyway disappear when we project the final fst. 2017-12-11T13:07:19+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Proper verbosity specification in a few more instances, and added weight pushing for the grammar checker speller now (how could I have missed that?). 2017-12-01T12:31:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in piped hfst-xfst commands: in three cases the -p option was missing, causing strange misbehavior in hfst-xfst on some systems. 2017-12-01T12:09:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further configure.ac cleanup: moved some variable definitions to other m4 files, moved the language definition on top, deprecated GTLANG* variables for GLANG* variants (ie Giella instead of GiellaTechno). Updated copyright year. 2017-12-01T10:27:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved all default AC_CONFIG_FILES into a separate function in a separate m4 file, to clean up configure.ac. Some other cleanup of configure.ac. 2017-12-01T09:32:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Defined variable for separate speller release version string. 2017-12-01T08:23:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed package name and version to more clearly be a real name and version number. 2017-12-01T08:07:13+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated comment in preparation for other changes. 2017-12-01T07:53:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for analysing whitespace and thus make it possible to tag whitespace errors (double spaces, extra spaces, etc), and also to more reliably detect sentence and paragraph borders by using whitespace as a delimiter. 2017-11-30T14:23:26+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug: forgot to remove a line. 2017-11-29T13:37:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the speller test scripts in devtools/ to be VPATH safe and rely on autotools for paths etc, so that the scripts will work also when only checking out single languages. 2017-11-29T13:00:15+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying language-specific files to be included in the grammar checker archive file. 2017-11-15T13:19:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated grammar checker files and build rules. 2017-11-13T09:47:19+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added hfst-push-weights to move transducer weights to the beginning of the strings, to enable proper optimisations of speller lookup in hfst-ospell. Stripped out most lang-specific stuff from grammar checker cg file, and added simple example rules + some explanations. Use gramcheck tokeniser in pre-pipe. 2017-11-07T15:46:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added default rule for speller suggestions, to make the suggestions survive cg treatment. 2017-10-25T09:54:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added spell checking component to the grammar checker pipeline. Now every planned component is working as it should. The spell checking requires first that one builds the latest hfst-ospell code, and then the newest grammar checker code for this to work. 2017-10-24T12:53:13+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Increased weights for fall-back rule-based hyphenation. Added .hfst suffix to rule fst for consistency. 2017-10-13T07:41:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced the huge sme grammar checker with the more moderate smn grammar checker cg file, as the template file for future grammar checkers. 2017-10-12T08:39:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added note (readme file) about NOT touching the local am-shared dir, to avoid future unintended changes. 2017-10-12T06:36:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the missing files for a working grammar checker. Fixed grammar checker build rules to not be dependent upon enabling tokenisers. 2017-10-11T18:23:32+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added conversion of the analysis tags from the grammar checker speller into CG format. 2017-10-11T05:53:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] One misplaced variable caused the grammar checker speller to be built independent of the configuration. This caused a build fail for everyone. Solves bug #2437. Also added $(srcdir) in front of root.lexc, to ensure that the file reference resolves correctly in local build targets. 2017-10-10T09:30:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the target clean-local to the local Makefile, to make it possible to enhance the clean target with locally generated files. 2017-10-10T09:01:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Correctiona to the grammar checker speller build: we now build a working zhfst file that can be used as part of the development cycle. Also additions to silent builds. 2017-10-04T07:00:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Major update to the grammar checker template. It still does not work completely as it should, so hold your horses. Update content: ensured that all files needed are copied to the grammar checker build dir, removed option to name files (=irrelevant bloat), now builds an almost proper zip file, and ensured that tokenisers are built before grammarcheckers. Also made it so that when grammar checkers are enabled, spellers are automatically enabled too, as they will be included as part of the grammar checker pipeline. 2017-10-03T07:01:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the file exists test for the lemma generation testing so that it will work even in cases where multiple source files are used as input. 2017-09-20T12:10:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made cg3 file compilation more general. 2017-09-19T14:19:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved the code to build the apertium relabel script in the apertium directory, so that we can use the actual giella-tagged fst for MT as the tag source. This should fix all issues of missing tags in the relabel script. 2017-09-15T14:15:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] GLE requires regex compilation possibilities in src/, no reason why it can't be. 2017-09-14T11:27:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a shortcoming in the build infra uncovered by gle: no explicit support for language-specific build rules that will not end up in lexicon.?fst. 2017-09-14T06:20:58+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved tag extraction to a separate am-include file, so that it can be shared between different dirs. Moved generation of regex for turning tags into CG friendly format from src/filters/ to tools/tokenisers/filters/. 2017-08-28T14:22:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] After a couple of bug fixes in giella-core, require the new version. 2017-08-25T10:11:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building tokenisers where the morphological analysis tags are given in CG format directly instead of having to be postprocess by hfst-tokenise before being printed. The idea is to make the hfst-tokenise code more general, and move everything that is particular to one language or setup go into the fst instead of being hardcoded in the C++ code. There are some issues that must be resolved, but fst-wise the code works. 2017-08-24T11:54:29+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building a regex that transform all tags from the format "+Adv" to " Adv" (including space). The idea is to make the tags readily consumable by CG. Both prefix and suffix tags are converted. Newest giella-core required. 2017-08-24T10:09:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Part two of renaming the preprocess dir to tokenisers. Now all refs to it are updated. 2017-08-24T07:29:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed the preprocess dir to tokenisers, to better describe the content of it. 2017-08-24T06:24:29+00:00
> added sent to set of DELIMITERS. 2017-08-16T18:19:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for diffing and merging on Linux. As part of that added checking for diff tools in m4/giella-macros.m4, and added more tests against failures. Also added test for cg-mwesplit, and increased the required vislcg3 version to the 1.0 release. 2017-08-16T10:52:11+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust test for the existence of the various vislcg3 files. 2017-08-15T12:22:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added more robust option checking, and a test for the existence of the specified corpus file. Also added some comments. 2017-08-15T07:17:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Actually open the other diff views. And force-add to svn - we don't want error messages in this context. 2017-08-14T14:47:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected glaring variable copy&paste bug. Thanks to Trond for spotting it! 2017-08-14T12:56:13+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed from the default build rules the automatic removal of +Comp tags in adverbs. That is definitely not a behavior we want universally. 2017-07-02T01:40:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the check_analysis_regressions.sh script to fail if you hadn't put giella-core/scripts/ in your path - which is not automatically done when you just checks out giella-core and your language of interest. 2017-06-30T00:57:44+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Made mobile spellers not build by default, even when enabling spellers. The mobile spellers must now be explicitly enabled. 2017-05-23T08:39:53+00:00
> Last Samest meeting notes. 2017-05-19T19:55:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed Ins() around Unknown. This triggered a bug(?) in hfst-tokenise, that caused wordforms not to be output. Speed and memory consumption should not be noticably affected. 2017-05-16T17:01:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved pmatch scripts - unification by reference instead of full fst unification. Reduces file size by ≈2/3, and runtime memory consumption by 50%. 2017-05-04T10:22:09+00:00
> One more link to fix 2017-04-19T14:06:59+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Further development of the analysis regression check: added support for diff views of all diff types, and now you can specify which diff view you want to see (and you must specify at least one). You can also override the default corpus, and specify a corpus of your own with the -c/--corpus option. Also corrected the initial description of the script in the help text, and added a diff view comparing the old pipeline using Xerox with the new pipeline using hfst-tokenise. This will help in finding unwanted differences between the two. 2017-03-17T12:48:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further improvements to the analysis regression check: only do function and dependency analysis if the required cg3 files exist. Also clarified the -d option and silenced the Xerox lookup tool. 2017-03-16T14:34:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved analysis regression check script: added a short help text, and added an option to ask for a diff between old-style (preprocess+lookup+lookup2cg) and new-style (hfst-tokenise+mwe-disamb+cg-mwesplit) morphological analysis. Intended to be used to find weak (and strong!) spots in the new-style morphological analysis. 2017-03-16T12:21:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the first version of a $LANG/devtools/ script that will process a corpus with the available tools, and compare the result against the previous version in the svn repository. The idea is to be able to easily spot regressions in analyses due to changes in the lexicons or CG rules. There are a number of rough edges, but it works. 2017-03-16T10:12:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Only remove generated lemma files if the lemma generation tests succeeds. 2017-03-14T14:42:06+00:00
> The XFAIL_TESTS variable was commented out. That causes the tests to FAIL, even in cases where we are aware of the errors but want to postpone fixing them. Commented the variable in again, so that 'make check' runs all the way through. 2017-03-13T12:56:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Only delete generated dic and tex files if one really wants to start anew. Do not delete the version.txt file, only the generated wordlist file. 2017-03-07T18:46:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Add the url parser also to the grammar checker tokeniser. 2017-03-07T15:01:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make the url.hfst a dependent of the hfst tokenising analyser. Improved the tokeniser based on recent changes in sme. 2017-03-06T17:08:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed automatic inclusion of the url parsing fst. The union with the regular fst blew up the total, in some cases more than 10x! The preferred way of adding it is to add it in the last steps of the *.tmp.fst > *.fst processing by loading it onto the stack (and inverse it for hfst) before saving the fst stack, and thus creating a transducer file with two fst's. Applying the input to them both will in effect union them, giving the output we want without blowing up the size of the fst file. 2017-03-03T14:19:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for compiling a lexc file for parsing URL's as such, giving them a separate tag. Only added to the descriptive analysers for now. Requires an updated version of giella-shared, due to the new file needed for the new functionality. 2017-03-02T14:17:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrects an inconsistency in the order of tag changing processing, where generators and analysers got their tags changed in different order, which caused different tags in some cases. Fixes bug #2264. Thanks to Heiki-Jaan Kaalep for the new and corrected code. 2017-03-02T06:40:00+00:00

> Last Samest meeting notes 2017-02-20T18:17:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Increased reqiured version of Python3, due to the updated speller test bench. 2017-02-15T08:02:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] New version of the speller test bench, now with sortable table columns, and optional timing of the suggestions for every input word (hfst-ospell-office only). Not finished, but working quite well. It is also possible now to specify the number of suggestions returned by hfst-ospell-office. 2017-02-14T09:38:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Increased required version of giella-core due to bug fix in the core. 2017-02-03T11:51:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Increased required version of giella-core due to changes in speller building. 2017-02-03T09:50:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] One more attempt at fixing the giella-common package bug. 2017-02-02T08:57:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added final step in building pattern-based hyphenators: now also prepared for Hunspell-like OOo hyphenation. Requires new version of the giella-core. Also corrected bug in checking the version number of giella-common. 2017-02-01T11:11:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Tex pattern based hyphenation generation works. The output must be checked and tested, and the process may have to be rerun several times to get the desired hyphenation behavior. Removed outcommented build code from the old infra - the new build code is essentially just a reformulation of the old one. 2017-01-31T14:44:34+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for checking the version of the giella-common package (aka giella-shared/). Added two new regexes to the source file list for shared regexes. Updated the required version of Hfst - it has not been updated in ages. 2017-01-31T13:56:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further work on the pattern based hyphenators: added tra file template, which is used to 'translate'  non-ASCII chars to ascii only for the pattern creation process. Initial build steps for the pattern build. 2017-01-31T12:26:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Improved the fst-based hyphenator by removing irrelevant paths from the fst. Started work on the pattern-based hyphenator, based on code from the old infra. 2017-01-31T11:12:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finished first version of fst-based hyphenator: now includes plain rules as a fall-back solution (including for misspelled words), and Err-tagged forms get a high weight penalty. In general, this seems to give good hyphenation patterns if one pick the first (lowest-weight) one. 2017-01-30T13:51:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First version of lexicon-based and fst-based hyphenation done. Works, but misses capitalised words, and does not give extra weights to Err-tagged word forms. Also no hyphenation of misspelled words yet. Hyphenation builds are off by default. 2017-01-30T12:14:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added template file for weighting tags when the fst is used as a hyphenator. 2017-01-30T10:42:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added check for cg-relabel when enabling apertium. Thanks to Flammie for identifying the issue. 2017-01-30T09:31:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added basic dir structure for building hyphenators. 2017-01-27T07:35:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced gtcore with giella-core. 2017-01-25T09:59:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added test dir for hyphenators, to store data from the old infra. 2017-01-23T10:54:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added test dirs for listbased spellcheckers, if we ever get to that. 2017-01-23T09:11:43+00:00
> Bidictopnary entries generation from previous incomplete translations. 2017-01-22T19:42:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed logical error in the handling of negated specified fst handling in yaml tests (e.g. ~xfst) - the test didn't work, and the yaml file was run when not intended. 2017-01-18T00:34:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed regression introduced in the previous commit: one-sided tests where included when looking for test data, causing a subsequent python fail when no actual test data was found. Fixed by using a stricter file name pattern. 2017-01-17T15:52:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added option to specify in a yaml filename that it should only be tested against a specific technology or not, by specifying one of .foma, .hfst or .xfst before the suffix part (before [.gen].yaml), and prefixed with '~' if negated (i.e. .~xfst for NOT running it against Xerox). 2017-01-17T08:48:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Slightly more robust yaml testing code. 2017-01-16T15:14:39+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the removal for dialect and variant tags from the grammar checker analyser, the information can be useful when generating suggestions for corrections. 2016-11-23T14:49:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed repetition of the frequency weighted fst. The goal was to promote compounds where each part was already seen in the corpus, but it made the speller bigger and slower, and actually decreased suggestion quality slightly. — Also added code to do manual priority union, but it is buggy and outcommented for now. 2016-11-21T11:49:44+00:00
> Corrected typo. 2016-11-19T10:55:01+00:00

Not the spellers build correctly under all intended circumstances given that there is a network connection. 2016-09-09T16:16:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path for the test for availability of the giella-common resources. 2016-09-09T11:31:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for getting precompiled proofing tools libraries across the net if not found locally. Makes it actually possible to build spellers without checking out the whole of $GIELLA_HOME. Now it is also possible to just check out $GIELLA_LIBS if one still wants to build everything locally. 2016-09-09T10:27:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Applied backend format rules to the tools/mt/ap/filters dir. This is not future proof, but does not create problems for sme, and solves a bug in smj. The future problem is that we mix both a specified backend format (for compilation efficiency) with the default/unspecified format fst (for weighting) in the same dir, and we can't automatically say which filters need to be in the specified backend format and which should be in the default format. This needs further consideration. 2016-09-02T08:20:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Completely clean src/transcriptions/, and also clean tools/mt/apertium/filters/. 2016-09-01T13:12:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Do not use PKG_CHECK_MODULES if you don't really have to - it clutters your code and creates unneeded variables = noise. 2016-08-31T11:17:39+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected placeholder string for two-letter ISO language code. 2016-08-25T20:22:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the path to the css for the xml speller test results in devtools. 2016-08-25T18:48:37+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] One small change to support spellers for alternative orthographies built off of the raw fst instead of the standard fst. 2016-08-23T22:05:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a possibility to build fst's for alternate orthographies based on the raw fst surface forms, instead of from the default/standard orthography. 2016-08-23T20:30:51+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed all references to $(GIELLA_SHARED)/common into $(GIELLA_SHARED)/all_langs. 2016-08-23T05:19:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the code for identifying the location of GIELLA_CORE (former GTCORE). The code should be more robust, and is prepared to check against a pkg-config pc file as well. GTCORE is still used throughout the code, but in parallel to GIELLA_CORE, so that one can easily replace the former with the latter without causing bugs or other problems. 2016-08-22T20:14:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added checking for and setting of GIELLA_TEMPLATES, but only if you have defined GIELLA_MAINTAINER (renamed from GTMAINTAINER). Otherwise it is ignored. 2016-08-22T14:58:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Revert experiment with priority union - it doesn't work as expected when weights are involved. Corrected filenames in the .SECONDARY target. 2016-08-19T12:21:39+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added download links to the build feedbad for 'make upload' in tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/desktop/hfst/. 2016-08-19T10:24:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Final step to make the GIELLA_SHARED dir be found in all cases: assign the path from pkg-config to the variable. 2016-08-18T10:33:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the separate test for content, instead adding the test to each possible location, moving to the next location if no data is found. 2016-08-18T09:46:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the search order for GIELLA_SHARED data: * using --with-giella-shared=/path/to/giella-shared/data/root/dir * env. variable GIELLA_SHARED * env. variable GIELLA_HOME * env. variable GTHOME * env. variable GTCORE * using pkg-config This way it is always possible to overtide everything else using the --with option. Added comments. 2016-08-18T08:59:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configure test to check that there is actually data in GIELLA_SHARED. 2016-08-18T08:03:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The giella-shared data dir is now found using several techniques in the following order: * evn. variable GIELLA_SHARED * evn. variable GIELLA_HOME * evn. variable GTHOME * evn. variable GTCORE * using --with-giella-shared=/dir/to/giella-shared * using pkg-config If all these fail, configure errors out. Since it a.o. uses GTHOME, the change should be of no concern to existing users having checked out everything. And since the svn location is still within GTCORE, it will also work for those checking out only the core and a single or a couple of languages without any action on their part. 2016-08-17T12:39:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Second steps in renaming and splitting the gtcore into giella-core, giella-shared and giella-templates: replaced $(GTCORE)/giella-shared with the Automake variable @GIELLA_SHARED@. 2016-08-15T12:14:16+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Added new test to check that the speller accepts all lemmas in the lexicon. Disabled another test that hangs for unknown reasons. 2016-06-09T21:55:50+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2016-06-09T20:04:14+00:00
< Removed empty lines. 2016-06-09T08:50:43+00:00
< Updated docu. 2016-06-09T08:50:06+00:00
< started to convert VVS lemmas and stems to 2-level representation 2016-06-08T17:51:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the pmatch compilation code to support Kevin's tokenisation hints for MWE-ambiguous entries. Requires Kevin's hfst fork for now. Work in progress. 2016-06-08T17:47:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Small change to support new style, backtracking based tokenisation experiments on space separated compounds in sme. 2016-06-08T07:43:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The next batch of changes to support building hfst fst's with a specified backend fst format: desktop spellers are now supported. The speller fst's will be built using the specified backend format up to the point where corpus and tag weights are added, when the fst format will be changed to the default (openfst-tropical) format. That is, even if you specify (the unweighted) sfst as the backend format, the final speller will still be weighted. 2016-06-06T10:05:04+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Better variable name and clearer comment about editing distance in spellers. 2016-06-02T10:43:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the build files for the desktop spellers to allow better user control of which files to include in the error model. 2016-06-01T11:15:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Use priority union to avoid duplication of paths and thus make a mutch smaller (and hence faster) mobile speller fst. 2016-05-31T19:17:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Use priority union to avoid duplication of paths and thus make a mutch smaller (and hence faster) speller fst. 2016-05-31T17:34:08+00:00

< everything is broken 2016-05-26T13:04:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building Oahpa fst's for alternate orthographies and writing systems. 2016-05-24T18:42:11+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the default build of grammar checker analysers. Blocked all languages without local overrides. 2016-05-23T12:24:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved removal of word boundaries out of the default, language-independent processing of the grammar checker analyser - we want to be able to do language-depending things with word boundaries, e.g. in freely compounding languages. 2016-05-19T12:41:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added provisions for including xfscript files in the src/morphology/ directory. 2016-05-18T13:48:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed unneeded subtraction that just increased the size of the resulting fst a lot (how much of course depends on the grammar in question). 2016-05-18T12:50:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for doing more targeted regex replacements on multichar sequences in parallel to the regular editdist operations. The idea is that these replacements can be applied more times (since they are few), and thus allow for more corrections of frequent spelling errors. 2016-05-18T06:32:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Restricted the new spellrelax to only give one tag. The previous version caused out-of-memory issues on a lot of systems. 2016-05-12T20:14:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternative orthographies in spellers. Works nicely in LO, but needs more testing. Also updated the clean target. 2016-05-11T17:51:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new spellrelax system that will add an +Err/ tag (or more) to the analysis of words misspelled according to the new spellrelax rules. Can be very costly in terms of size if applied to large lexical fst's, and if many error types are tagged, so initially it is only applied to the transcriptor fst (which are used in Oahpa). Template data is from Plains Cree (crk). 2016-05-11T03:41:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed compilation error: added missing inversion (.i). 2016-05-10T23:50:14+00:00
< Changed the stem vowel set label from V to stemV. V made compilation halt (V also was declared an ordinary letter). Now the file compiles (save the recent changes to the Diacritics section). 2016-05-10T14:02:37+00:00
< correct the file list in svn 2016-05-10T13:42:50+00:00
< tag reordering script in the right place and form (thanks to Jaak) 2016-05-10T08:51:31+00:00
< +Use/... to multichars 2016-05-10T08:36:44+00:00
< Setting svn ignore patterns on tools/spellcheckers/filters/. 2016-05-10T01:00:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the final file format for hfst transcriptors to the hfstol format. 2016-05-10T00:41:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in speller building with Xerox tools enabled. 2016-05-10T00:09:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for filters for the top-level speller dir, in preparations for needs by the Haida spellers. 2016-05-09T05:22:51+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] One more bugfix for tag reordering with language-specific additions. 2016-05-05T21:03:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug for tag reordering with language-specific additions. Made building of glossing fst's configurable, and at the same time fixed a build bug for them. 2016-05-05T20:37:46+00:00
< est-phon.twolc needs repair 2016-05-05T19:02:07+00:00
< affixes dir populated 2016-05-05T18:54:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for hfst-based tokenisers, built on generalisations of Kevin's work. They are built using the hfst-tool hfst-pmatch2fst, which is the Hfst implementation of the pmatch tool from Xerox. Supports a regular tokeniser, and one targeted at grammar checking. 2016-05-05T16:15:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected errors in the makefile that stopped dictionary fst builds for languages with alternative orthographies. 2016-05-04T08:49:24+00:00
< simplex words paradigms with usage info; wrong directory structure (makefile incorrect); regular paradigms covered 2016-05-03T14:33:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Build analyser for grammar checker when grammar checkers are enabled. 2016-05-03T12:37:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Generalised hack to force make to go via hfst instead of directly to hfstol. 2016-05-02T13:24:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying backend fst format also for (parts of the) apertium fst's. One step further to speed up compilation by specifying e.g. sfst as the backend format. The implementation is a bit hacky, but will have to do for now. 2016-04-29T15:27:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building glossing analysers, where the analysis tags are NOT shifted around to canonical positions. The idea is that one keeps tags and morphs together in the lexc code, and that the analyser output thus will reflect the order of the surface morphs. If one wants to build such analysers, one has to specify the final analyser filename in src/Makefile.am. 2016-04-29T13:46:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrections to make the Oahpa builds work, and also to properly build with foma. 2016-04-21T13:30:51+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected an error that made the new option to select fst format (=backend) in hfst non-functional. 2016-04-21T10:35:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now also Oahpa transducers are ready to be built with a specified backend format when building using hfst. Also cleaned up the code, removed 300+ lines of code, and added support for builds using Foma. 2016-04-21T10:09:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A number of corrections to the previous commit for issues missed during the first round of testing. Now specifying an alternative backend format works correctly for all standard analysers and generators except for Oahpa-fst's. 2016-04-21T07:00:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled the new option to specify transducer format when compiling with Hfst, to speed up compilation time by using an unweighted format (ie sfst or foma). Default is still openfst-tropical, until further testing is done. 2016-04-20T14:32:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further preparations for enabling the new option to choose the backend format for fst's, for compilation speed improvements in cases where weight is not used: generalisations and corrections of build instructions. 2016-04-20T13:58:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Bummer: wrong default backend format - only openfst-tropical is stable, the other formats are more or less buggy. 2016-04-20T10:21:47+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More preparations for new configure option to specify backend format of compiled fst's. 2016-04-20T10:08:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for new configure option to specify backend format of compiled fst's. Removed some old code. 2016-04-20T09:31:45+00:00
< Ignore more preprocessor files = fst’s. 2016-04-14T16:01:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further abstractions over parallel patterns, reducing code size. 2016-04-06T08:37:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Remove generated files also in tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. 2016-03-17T08:24:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated required versions for Hfst and VislCG3. A number of bug fixes and new features require these versions for many of our tools. 2016-03-17T07:24:56+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2016-03-15T19:55:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] One pattern rule had for some reason become ambiguous, and caused strange build behavior. Replaced with full filename in one stable case solved the issue. 2016-03-10T23:18:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] cut on linux does not like unicode chars as delimiters, use awk instead. 2016-03-08T19:25:46+00:00
< Use a more general svn ignore pattern in src/morphology/. 2016-03-07T17:11:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Code cleanup - moved target variables related to running xfst tools to the xfscript include file, and thereby removing duplicate code. 2016-03-07T08:24:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to enable building tokenisers, off by default. 2016-03-04T09:28:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Do the CG3 tag relabelling in the Giella infra, not in Apertium. 2016-02-29T10:50:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to rename the Area variable in the previous commit. 2016-02-26T16:00:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First iteration of adding support for Area codes (ie countries) based on ISO 3166 codes. Right now does nothing except filtering out the tags, proper support coming in steps. Requires new version of the GTCORE scripts. 2016-02-26T15:47:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of hfst/xfst/foma for the top-level speller dir - invert when needed. 2016-02-24T13:36:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] There was still one more automake file with references to the remove-derivation-position-tags.regex filter. Now they are gone. 2016-02-24T10:46:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A typo made reversed compose&intersect seem buggy, whereas in fact it was not. 2016-02-23T14:42:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Small correction to bring the Giella version of reversed comp&intersect closer to what Miikka has: added minimisation to the reversed twolc rules. 2016-02-23T12:25:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to reverse the lexicon and the morph-phon rules during composition and intersection. Reduced the time needed for that operation to ≈1/3 of what it used to be in SMS, and RAM consumption went down from 11Gb to max 400Mb! Speed and RAM gains will vary from language to language. 2016-02-22T12:04:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now the lexical fst is first compiled into a .tmp file, to allow language-specific changes to be applied from .tmp to final file. More support for xfscript compilation. 2016-02-22T08:31:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added include to xfscfript-include.am, to let xfscripts be used in lexc compilation. 2016-02-20T21:22:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Second part of libdir cleanup: removed the libdir line in the pkgconf file. 2016-02-19T18:14:43+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] libdir -> datadir for zhfst installations using autotools. 2016-02-19T17:11:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed some references to remove-derivation-position-tags.regex that were forgotten in commit r129657. 2016-02-19T12:10:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added analyser-disamb-gt-desc.hfst as a noinst_DATA target, to force make to build it instead of going directly to the *.hfstol file, and thus breaking compilation when local modifications are needed. 2016-02-19T07:19:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added INVERT_<FSTTECH> variables to help in improving compilation of analysers and generators for different fst technologies (Xerox, Hfst, Foma). Hfst has the inversed convention for lookup compared to the other two, and by using a variable we can now actually share the same build code irrespective of which one we need to inverse for the final analyser or generator. 2016-02-18T13:19:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the remove-derivation-position-tags filter from language-independent processing, it is language-specific, and will be added to the languages needing it. This also makes it possible to do further local processing dependent on these tags. 2016-02-18T09:47:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Error out if Hfst is requested but not found or too old. 2016-02-17T12:34:49+00:00
< Updated the svn ignore script with recent additions to the infrastructure. 2016-02-16T22:23:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] LibreOffice-voikko 5.0 support for spellers with alternating writing systems. 2016-02-05T00:43:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building zhfst files for mobile phone keyboards. This version is essentially the same as the desktop one, we'll start from here and adapt as we find better solutions. The zhfst file is compressed using xz for optimal file size (this is presently in violation of the zhfst specification, it must be updated soon). Also changed some of the configure options to error out when requested but without the required software installed - this is better than silently turning the requested feature off. 2016-02-04T12:09:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Cleaned the speller build and configuration code in preparation for adding support for building mobile spellers. 2016-02-03T17:36:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a missing SUBDIR, and fixed a speller test script that was not working. 2016-02-03T08:43:55+00:00
< Updating svn:ignore’s. 2016-02-02T15:31:07+00:00
< Updating svn:ignore’s. 2016-02-02T15:21:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updating path in test script. 2016-02-02T15:15:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moving the hfst speller test dir inside test/tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/desktop/. 2016-02-02T15:00:47+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Preparing to reorganise the speller testing parallel to what has been done in the development dir. 2016-02-02T12:53:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Updated path to desktop speller files. 2016-02-02T10:58:50+00:00
< Updated svn:ignore’s. 2016-02-02T10:34:44+00:00
< Udating svn:ignore’s. 2016-02-01T22:18:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Major reorganisation to support building zhfst files for mobile systems (aka keyboard + speller). These need very different weighting priorities, another error model, and are thus placed in a separate subdirectory from desktop spellers. 2016-02-01T22:10:43+00:00
< First step in adding support for mobile phone spellers. 2016-01-31T22:10:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building LO-voikko 5.0 extensions. Python-based interface to LO, and initial support for specifying unknown speller languages by typing in the language code in the language name field. 2016-01-30T08:08:22+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2016-01-25T08:12:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out xz compression, it isn't supported by libvoikko. 2016-01-25T07:59:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed test pair conventions for twolc from !€/!$ to !!€/!!$ to make it follow the conventions in the rest of the infrastructure, and make it possible to include test data in the documentation. 2016-01-13T08:26:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Readded the initial-letter edits in the regex - everything else is there for the initial letter machinery, so leaving it out made the build inconsistent. The default is off, with a large warning for those turning it on. 2015-12-08T16:11:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added script to run suggestion testing for the hfst-ospell-service (MS Office) speller. Rewrote the speller testing scripts to allow parallel execution. 2015-12-08T14:08:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make transitivity tags optional also for the Apertium generator. 2015-12-02T14:02:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Push weights even when not minimising the speller acceptor. Minimisation is not always the best strategy. 2015-12-01T13:29:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed --Werror from the language-independent automake file. Added a variable to make it possible to add it to the language-specific automake file. 2015-11-27T14:51:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to enable symbol alignment during lexc compilation for the lexical transducer. Defaults to off for now, we need to test the effect on various languages before making it default to on. Also added --Werror to lexc to make it break on all warnings when compiling the lexical fst. 2015-11-27T12:59:47+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Use tar + xz for a 40-50 % reduction in file size for zhfst files. 2015-11-27T09:15:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Allow longer filenames by using tar-pax for make dist. 2015-11-26T09:49:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added upload target for zhfst files. That will be the only method for spell checking in more than one language for now (for regular users). Not ideal, but have no time for anything else. 2015-11-25T13:00:20+00:00
< Updated svn:ignore’s. 2015-11-18T23:09:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Ensure that all required cg3 files are copied over to the apertium dir. Also make sure that included files are copied before including files are processed. 2015-11-18T20:06:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Silent build updates for Apertium. 2015-11-18T17:12:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] No morphology backend for now in our infra. Corrected typo. 2015-11-18T14:00:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for the vfst fst format for voikko-based spellers, to be used in mobile apps. 2015-11-18T10:03:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo. 2015-11-17T06:53:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Upload xpi and MacVoikko files, beta versions. 2015-11-16T22:23:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Look for saxon in $HOME/lib first. Fixes bug http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2100. 2015-11-11T07:50:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Add lexicon version to the speller testing output. 2015-11-11T05:50:09+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new variable HAS_FOMA, which will be set independently of the configuration if foma is available. This can be used to circumvent bugs in Hfst if weights are not needed: if foma is available, print as ATT, read in foma, perform transformations, print as ATT, convert, and continue. 2015-11-10T10:15:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Error out if one tries to build abbr files with generators disabled. 2015-11-09T10:19:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Error out if syntax is enabled and no vislcg3 is found or too old. 2015-11-09T09:59:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building abbr.txt. Copy of the sme template committed in r111579. 2015-11-09T09:43:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added targets for foma spellers, outcommented now due to build issues. Added more silent build strings. 2015-11-04T12:28:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added some general tag cleanup before making the speller fst used as input for the analyser and generator that is the last step before building the acceptor, Makes it easier to write yaml tests for the speller fst's. 2015-10-26T11:52:59+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-10-20T07:52:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added filter to remove tags irrelevant to speller builds. Adjusted required version of GTCORE accordingly. 2015-10-19T07:33:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected a bug with filter compilations for speller filters involving tag conversion to flag diacritics. 2015-10-15T10:15:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst is always built, to ensure we have the necessary prerequisites for all targets. Refactored the initial speller fst build to use common build code for all fst technologies. Makes it possible to easier test and compare test results when debugging. 2015-10-14T12:49:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the response to missing transducers from FAIL to SKIP to avoid problems with lexc tests for fst's not enabled and thus not available. Instead report the missing fst to the user. 2015-10-05T10:42:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Streamlined descriptive compounding tags to follow a shared tag structure. 2015-10-03T09:26:12+00:00
< Replaced +RCmpnd with +Cmp/SplitR (and escaped variants) using the following commands: 2015-10-03T08:33:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a comment about the non-functioning of the initial edit setting. Made the compound-restricted fst a tmp file, to allow for additional local processing. 2015-09-29T08:15:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed all minimization of the error model except for the final build step. Removed also the initial letter handling for now, it blows up the error model, and slows it down correspondingly, making spellers that has turned this on useless. For now we apply the regular error model on the first letter, that seems to work ok. 2015-09-28T17:51:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a very short test script written by Lene to help run a subset of tests frequently needed. 2015-09-25T10:49:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a problem running bc on the linux servers, which caused the yaml test summaries to be blank. Fixes bug #2054. 2015-09-24T13:43:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to specify how many lines of the frequency corpus to be used in the frequency weighting, to trim the acceptor fst at a point where the weights don't really matter. 2015-09-23T10:42:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced 'giellatekno' with 'giella' or added Divvun, depending on context. 2015-09-18T17:15:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed m4/giellatekno.m4 to bring it in line with the switch to 'giella' for all things common to GT and Divvun. 2015-09-18T10:25:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The previous commit did not solve the issue - the different jars where checked in the wrong order. Now it should be ok. 2015-09-18T10:03:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added standard Linux location for Saxon to the paths searched. Fixes bug #2080. 2015-09-18T07:32:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path for pkgconfig data and one variable name in MT filters. 2015-09-16T14:19:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] gtdshared has been renamed to giella-shared, all references now updated. 2015-09-16T11:40:54+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More robust handling of MWE in speller testing. Now also possible to specify build dir different from source dir. 2015-09-16T08:22:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a Makefile.am variable to turn on or off corpus-based (frequency) weighting of suggestions. Default for the time being is off while we work out the best interactions between the different parts of the spellers. Changed one intermediary filename to ensure proper dependency checks and thus rebuilds. 2015-09-16T07:01:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying regexes or list of string pairs for initial and final symbols in the error model. Also added a Makefile variable to control whether to allow edits of the initial letter(s), default is ‘no’. 2015-09-15T13:17:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Guard against -q for lookups that don't support it. 2015-09-09T13:34:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Small code cleanup that has been lingering since June. 2015-09-09T09:14:53+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Made new of a new option for the speller suggestion testing: output an attribute on each test word element containing essential info about the correct suggestion. This will support better styling of the xml file with the test data. Also changed the path to the css from the local filesystem (which will vary from machine to machine) to the svn repository web url. 2015-09-07T13:09:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to hold source files to be included in the distro but not compiled as such. 2015-09-03T20:16:46+00:00
< Ignore temporary files generated by the speller suggestion test script. 2015-09-02T20:01:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added first version of a shell script to check the suggestions generated by spellers. Requires the file test/data/typos.txt for data input. 2015-09-02T19:44:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Shortened a filename to make tar happy when building distribution packages. 2015-09-02T13:29:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed an error in distcheck - one test shell script was not included. 2015-09-02T09:02:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Made one step in the speller build behave properly wrt silent builds. Removed grammar checker targets, we are far from ready for this, and it breaks 'make distcheck'. 2015-09-02T07:00:32+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to pass a compilation option to hfst-regexp2fst. Used this variable to compile all filter regexes with the option --xerox-composition=ON. This will ensure that all filters where flag diacritics are used as symbols will be compiled correctly for proper used in later compositions. A.o. this fixes a bug where tags converted to flags to restrict compounding did not work at all. 2015-09-01T17:58:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced sed expression with double cut - the sed did not work on the xserve for whatever reason, and caused the testing to hang. 2015-08-17T09:56:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More robust checking of Saxon, now requires that any jar found is at least v8.0. 2015-08-17T08:07:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added /usr/share/java/ as a search path for the Saxon jar, this is what is used on the UiT Linux virtual machines, and probably many other Linux systems. 2015-08-14T06:53:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building Mozvoikko spellers for our languages. 2015-08-13T08:10:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Adding support for specifying one-sided tests (half tests) in the lexc test data, using an optional .gen or .ana "suffix" after the fst name. Simplified source file processing. 2015-08-06T12:08:46+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] When building with Foma, use the new lexc-align feature. 2015-06-12T23:26:57+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added lexicon filtering when pair-testing twolc rules. 2015-06-11T14:40:01+00:00
< Files renamed according to common practice. Added punctuation from the template. 2015-06-10T05:02:21+00:00
< Deleted file from template, an old file existed under a different name. 2015-06-10T05:00:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected e-mail address, changed the template content of the transcription files from SMA to CRK, and at the same time corrected the direction of the code. Also added a default punctuation lexicon. 2015-06-09T21:42:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for easter eggs specific to alternative writing systems and other variants. Will help in debugging. 2015-06-07T19:54:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved specification of default weight and editing distance to the language specific Makefile. 2015-06-05T01:43:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] After a lot of experimenting, a moderate set of changes to the speller error models. The biggest change is that the alphabet for the edit distance error model is not taken from the acceptor anymore, but must be explicitly listed in the editdist.*.txt file. The suggestion speed is back to normal, but more work is needed re the interaction of the error model and corpus weights. 2015-06-05T01:11:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Prefixed all silent build strings for Hfst tools with H, for easier identification. 2015-06-04T10:06:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out the old target for calculating unit weights (default weight for out-of-corpus word forms), and added a new which is basically the highest tropical weight + the ALPHA smoothing value. This is just the first step in further developing the suggestion ordering for the spellers. 2015-05-27T14:55:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a simple test to check a minimum suggestion speed for our test word nuvviDspeller. No speller should be released that does not pass this test. Additional and more elaborate tests should be added as well, this is just the very bare minimum in suggestion speed testing. 2015-05-25T14:08:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in twolc compilation for foma (using hfst). 2015-05-24T13:50:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Worked around a bug in hfst-fst2fst by going via att and foma instead. 2015-05-23T09:15:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for compiling twolc files for foma by way of hfst, intersect and conversion to foma format. 2015-05-23T05:39:37+00:00

> Notes from the last Samest meeting. 2016-06-17T08:17:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in speller builds introduced lately - missing hfst target. 2016-06-11T14:58:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated filename reference, and added a pmatch setting fixes that the issue where words next to punctuation like "ja." don't get analysed. 2016-06-11T06:19:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed '+' in front of tag patterns to be extracted from the tag list and used as input to regex generation scripts. This was done to accomodate the use of prefix tags, where the '+' is at the end of the tag, not in the beginning. 2016-06-09T23:01:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added new test to check that the speller accepts all lemmas in the lexicon. Disabled another test that hangs for unknown reasons. 2016-06-09T22:11:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Rewrote the pmatch compilation code to support Kevin's tokenisation hints for MWE-ambiguous entries. Requires Kevin's hfst fork for now. Work in progress. 2016-06-08T17:49:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Small change to support new style, backtracking based tokenisation experiments on space separated compounds in sme. 2016-06-08T07:44:39+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] The next batch of changes to support building hfst fst's with a specified backend fst format: desktop spellers are now supported. The speller fst's will be built using the specified backend format up to the point where corpus and tag weights are added, when the fst format will be changed to the default (openfst-tropical) format. That is, even if you specify (the unweighted) sfst as the backend format, the final speller will still be weighted. 2016-06-06T10:18:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better variable name and clearer comment about editing distance in spellers. 2016-06-02T10:43:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the build files for the desktop spellers to allow better user control of which files to include in the error model. 2016-06-01T11:15:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Use priority union to avoid duplication of paths and thus make a mutch smaller (and hence faster) mobile speller fst. 2016-05-31T19:18:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Use priority union to avoid duplication of paths and thus make a mutch smaller (and hence faster) speller fst. 2016-05-31T17:35:35+00:00
> Updated documentation. 2016-05-25T20:25:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug in building Oahpa fst's for alternate orthographies and writing systems. 2016-05-24T18:41:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the default build of grammar checker analysers. Blocked all languages without local overrides. 2016-05-23T12:28:13+00:00
> Yesterday's Samest project meeting notes. 2016-05-20T19:22:42+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved removal of word boundaries out of the default, language-independent processing of the grammar checker analyser - we want to be able to do language-depending things with word boundaries, e.g. in freely compounding languages. 2016-05-19T12:45:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added provisions for including xfscript files in the src/morphology/ directory. 2016-05-18T13:54:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed unneeded subtraction that just increased the size of the resulting fst a lot (how much of course depends on the grammar in question). 2016-05-18T12:59:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for doing more targeted regex replacements on multichar sequences in parallel to the regular editdist operations. The idea is that these replacements can be applied more times (since they are few), and thus allow for more corrections of frequent spelling errors. 2016-05-18T06:39:00+00:00
> FST subgroup meeting logs 2016-05-17T08:25:50+00:00
> Added language code. 2016-05-14T21:03:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Restricted the new spellrelax to only give one tag. The previous version caused out-of-memory issues on a lot of systems. 2016-05-12T20:46:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternative orthographies in spellers. Works nicely in LO, but needs more testing. Also updated the clean target. 2016-05-11T18:07:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new spellrelax system that will add an +Err/ tag (or more) to the analysis of words misspelled according to the new spellrelax rules. Can be very costly in terms of size if applied to large lexical fst's, and if many error types are tagged, so initially it is only applied to the transcriptor fst (which are used in Oahpa). Template data is from Plains Cree (crk). 2016-05-11T03:54:30+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed compilation error: added missing inversion (.i). 2016-05-10T23:53:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Changed the final file format for hfst transcriptors to the hfstol format. 2016-05-10T00:54:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in speller building with Xerox tools enabled. 2016-05-10T00:12:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for filters for the top-level speller dir, in preparations for needs by the Haida spellers. 2016-05-09T05:31:01+00:00
> Added Personal pronoun tag. 2016-05-07T19:05:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] One more bugfix for tag reordering with language-specific additions. 2016-05-05T21:05:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bug for tag reordering with language-specific additions. Made building of glossing fst's configurable, and at the same time fixed a build bug for them. 2016-05-05T20:45:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added initial support for hfst-based tokenisers, built on generalisations of Kevin's work. They are built using the hfst-tool hfst-pmatch2fst, which is the Hfst implementation of the pmatch tool from Xerox. Supports a regular tokeniser, and one targeted at grammar checking. 2016-05-05T16:34:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected errors in the makefile that stopped dictionary fst builds for languages with alternative orthographies. 2016-05-04T08:51:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Build analyser for grammar checker when grammar checkers are enabled. 2016-05-03T12:36:43+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Generalised hack to force make to go via hfst instead of directly to hfstol. 2016-05-02T13:24:10+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying backend fst format also for (parts of the) apertium fst's. One step further to speed up compilation by specifying e.g. sfst as the backend format. The implementation is a bit hacky, but will have to do for now. 2016-04-29T15:28:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for building glossing analysers, where the analysis tags are NOT shifted around to canonical positions. The idea is that one keeps tags and morphs together in the lexc code, and that the analyser output thus will reflect the order of the surface morphs. If one wants to build such analysers, one has to specify the final analyser filename in src/Makefile.am. 2016-04-29T13:48:47+00:00
> Yesterday's est fst meeting notes. 2016-04-27T10:11:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrections to make the Oahpa builds work, and also to properly build with foma. 2016-04-21T13:30:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected an error that made the new option to select fst format (=backend) in hfst non-functional. 2016-04-21T10:36:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now also Oahpa transducers are ready to be built with a specified backend format when building using hfst. Also cleaned up the code, removed 300+ lines of code, and added support for builds using Foma. 2016-04-21T10:09:40+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] A number of corrections to the previous commit for issues missed during the first round of testing. Now specifying an alternative backend format works correctly for all standard analysers and generators except for Oahpa-fst's. 2016-04-21T07:05:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled the new option to specify transducer format when compiling with Hfst, to speed up compilation time by using an unweighted format (ie sfst or foma). Default is still openfst-tropical, until further testing is done. 2016-04-21T05:39:13+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further preparations for enabling the new option to choose the backend format for fst's, for compilation speed improvements in cases where weight is not used: generalisations and corrections of build instructions. 2016-04-20T13:59:57+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Bummer: wrong default backend format - only openfst-tropical is stable, the other formats are more or less buggy. 2016-04-20T10:22:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More preparations for new configure option to specify backend format of compiled fst's. 2016-04-20T10:10:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for new configure option to specify backend format of compiled fst's. Removed some old code. 2016-04-20T09:33:57+00:00
> Today's Samest meeting notes. 2016-04-18T18:42:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further abstractions over parallel patterns, reducing code size. 2016-04-06T08:35:53+00:00
> Friday's SamEst meeting notes. 2016-04-04T12:57:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Remove generated files also in tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. 2016-03-17T08:25:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Updated required versions for Hfst and VislCG3. A number of bug fixes and new features require these versions for many of our tools. 2016-03-17T07:25:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] One pattern rule had for some reason become ambiguous, and caused strange build behavior. Replaced with full filename in one stable case solved the issue. 2016-03-10T23:21:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] cut on linux does not like unicode chars as delimiters, use awk instead. 2016-03-08T19:31:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Code cleanup - moved target variables related to running xfst tools to the xfscript include file, and thereby removing duplicate code. 2016-03-07T08:28:08+00:00
> Today's SamEst meeting 2016-03-04T18:19:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to enable building tokenisers, off by default. 2016-03-04T09:37:44+00:00
> Added the subcategorisation of adpositions by Po/Pr and valency SubClasses. Temporarily retained also Adp alone reading until suitable place is found for defining local tags to be included in (desc?) analysers but ignored in generators as some default homonymy or transitivity tags. 2016-03-03T17:43:21+00:00
> Corrections for teinud, tehtud, ütelnud, öelnud, öeldud, mõtelnud, mõelnud, mõeldud, õmmelnud, õmmeldud, types 28, 30. 2016-03-02T17:42:39+00:00
> Corrections for saadetud, võetud, osanud types 29, 34, 35. 2016-03-02T17:01:25+00:00
> Corrections for süüakse/juuakse type 38. 2016-03-02T15:34:30+00:00
> Corrected past participle forms of tundma from tundetu to tuntu and others of type 34. 2016-03-02T13:11:14+00:00
> Some more words. 2016-03-01T22:07:07+00:00
> Corrected affix rules for verbs of type 34-36, including 'pesema' which was in exceptions list. 2016-02-29T13:33:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do the CG3 tag relabelling in the Giella infra, not in Apertium. 2016-02-29T10:53:03+00:00
> Changed Negs to ConNegs and Sg/Pl to Sg/Pl123 for personal pronouns 2016-02-29T01:06:04+00:00
> Two more missing Imprt Negs 2016-02-28T21:33:44+00:00
> Kohvi + Nom 2016-02-28T19:22:40+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to rename the Area variable in the previous commit. 2016-02-26T16:02:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First iteration of adding support for Area codes (ie countries) based on ISO 3166 codes. Right now does nothing except filtering out the tags, proper support coming in steps. Requires new version of the GTCORE scripts. 2016-02-26T15:51:15+00:00
> overagressive filters, allow "lexicalized" genattributes again. 2016-02-26T15:50:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Better handling of hfst/xfst/foma for the top-level speller dir - invert when needed. 2016-02-24T13:44:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] There was still one more automake file with references to the remove-derivation-position-tags.regex filter. Now they are gone. 2016-02-24T10:47:12+00:00
> Notes from the today's Samest meeting. 2016-02-23T16:38:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] A typo made reversed compose&intersect seem buggy, whereas in fact it was not. 2016-02-23T14:43:02+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Small correction to bring the Giella version of reversed comp&intersect closer to what Miikka has: added minimisation to the reversed twolc rules. 2016-02-23T12:25:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to reverse the lexicon and the morph-phon rules during composition and intersection. Reduced the time needed for that operation to ≈1/3 of what it used to be in SMS, and RAM consumption went down from 11Gb to max 400Mb! Speed and RAM gains will vary from language to language. 2016-02-22T12:18:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Now the lexical fst is first compiled into a .tmp file, to allow language-specific changes to be applied from .tmp to final file. More support for xfscript compilation. 2016-02-22T08:30:00+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added include to xfscfript-include.am, to let xfscripts be used in lexc compilation. 2016-02-21T09:07:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Second part of libdir cleanup: removed the libdir line in the pkgconf file. 2016-02-19T18:14:31+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] libdir -> datadir for zhfst installations using autotools. 2016-02-19T17:04:29+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed some references to remove-derivation-position-tags.regex that were forgotten in commit r129657. 2016-02-19T12:10:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added analyser-disamb-gt-desc.hfst as a noinst_DATA target, to force make to build it instead of going directly to the *.hfstol file, and thus breaking compilation when local modifications are needed. 2016-02-19T07:21:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added INVERT_<FSTTECH> variables to help in improving compilation of analysers and generators for different fst technologies (Xerox, Hfst, Foma). Hfst has the inversed convention for lookup compared to the other two, and by using a variable we can now actually share the same build code irrespective of which one we need to inverse for the final analyser or generator. 2016-02-18T13:24:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed the remove-derivation-position-tags filter from language-independent processing, it is language-specific, and will be added to the languages needing it. This also makes it possible to do further local processing dependent on these tags. 2016-02-18T09:56:05+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] LibreOffice-voikko 5.0 support for spellers with alternating writing systems. 2016-02-05T01:00:37+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building zhfst files for mobile phone keyboards. This version is essentially the same as the desktop one, we'll start from here and adapt as we find better solutions. The zhfst file is compressed using xz for optimal file size (this is presently in violation of the zhfst specification, it must be updated soon). Also changed some of the configure options to error out when requested but without the required software installed - this is better than silently turning the requested feature off. 2016-02-04T12:15:18+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure option to enable symbol alignment during lexc compilation for the lexical transducer. Defaults to off for now, we need to test the effect on various languages before making it default to on. Also added --Werror to lexc to make it break on all warnings when compiling the lexical fst. 2015-11-27T12:58:57+00:00

> Mostly technical changes to comply with the last vislcg3 version. 2015-10-25T16:12:47+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Streamlined descriptive compounding tags to follow a shared tag structure. 2015-10-03T09:22:13+00:00
> Replaced +LCmpnd+ with +Cmp/SplitL using the following commands: 2015-10-03T08:26:16+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a comment about the non-functioning of the initial edit setting. Made the compound-restricted fst a tmp file, to allow for additional local processing. 2015-09-29T08:10:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed all minimization of the error model except for the final build step. Removed also the initial letter handling for now, it blows up the error model, and slows it down correspondingly, making spellers that has turned this on useless. For now we apply the regular error model on the first letter, that seems to work ok. 2015-09-28T17:49:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a very short test script written by Lene to help run a subset of tests frequently needed. 2015-09-25T10:44:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a problem running bc on the linux servers, which caused the yaml test summaries to be blank. Fixes bug #2054. 2015-09-24T13:43:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an option to specify how many lines of the frequency corpus to be used in the frequency weighting, to trim the acceptor fst at a point where the weights don't really matter. 2015-09-23T10:36:12+00:00
> Work started on Vasta-S grammar rules: some initial rules for the first templates. 2015-09-21T02:40:52+00:00

> update 2015-09-21T02:30:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced 'giellatekno' with 'giella' or added Divvun, depending on context. 2015-09-18T15:40:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Renamed m4/giellatekno.m4 to bring it in line with the switch to 'giella' for all things common to GT and Divvun. 2015-09-18T10:20:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] The previous commit did not solve the issue - the different jars where checked in the wrong order. Now it should be ok. 2015-09-18T09:59:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added standard Linux location for Saxon to the paths searched. Fixes bug #2080. 2015-09-18T07:29:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected path for pkgconfig data and one variable name in MT filters. 2015-09-16T14:13:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] gtdshared has been renamed to giella-shared, all references now updated. 2015-09-16T11:34:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust handling of MWE in speller testing. Now also possible to specify build dir different from source dir. 2015-09-16T08:12:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a Makefile.am variable to turn on or off corpus-based (frequency) weighting of suggestions. Default for the time being is off while we work out the best interactions between the different parts of the spellers. Changed one intermediary filename to ensure proper dependency checks and thus rebuilds. 2015-09-16T06:54:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for specifying regexes or list of string pairs for initial and final symbols in the error model. Also added a Makefile variable to control whether to allow edits of the initial letter(s), default is ‘no’. 2015-09-15T13:06:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Guard against -q for lookups that don't support it. 2015-09-09T13:24:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Small code cleanup that has been lingering since June. 2015-09-09T08:55:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made new of a new option for the speller suggestion testing: output an attribute on each test word element containing essential info about the correct suggestion. This will support better styling of the xml file with the test data. Also changed the path to the css from the local filesystem (which will vary from machine to machine) to the svn repository web url. 2015-09-07T12:58:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to hold source files to be included in the distro but not compiled as such. 2015-09-03T10:30:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added first version of a shell script to check the suggestions generated by spellers. Requires the file test/data/typos.txt for data input. 2015-09-02T19:41:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Shortened a filename to make tar happy when building distribution packages. 2015-09-02T12:28:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed an error in distcheck - one test shell script was not included. 2015-09-02T08:59:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Made one step in the speller build behave properly wrt silent builds. Removed grammar checker targets, we are far from ready for this, and it breaks 'make distcheck'. 2015-09-02T06:55:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a variable to pass a compilation option to hfst-regexp2fst. Used this variable to compile all filter regexes with the option --xerox-composition=ON. This will ensure that all filters where flag diacritics are used as symbols will be compiled correctly for proper used in later compositions. A.o. this fixes a bug where tags converted to flags to restrict compounding did not work at all. 2015-09-01T14:30:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced sed expression with double cut - the sed did not work on the xserve for whatever reason, and caused the testing to hang. 2015-08-17T09:54:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust checking of Saxon, now requires that any jar found is at least v8.0. 2015-08-17T08:05:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added /usr/share/java/ as a search path for the Saxon jar, this is what is used on the UiT Linux virtual machines, and probably many other Linux systems. 2015-08-14T06:50:24+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Initial support for building Mozvoikko spellers for our languages. 2015-08-13T08:05:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Adding support for specifying one-sided tests (half tests) in the lexc test data, using an optional .gen or .ana "suffix" after the fst name. Simplified source file processing. 2015-08-06T11:42:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] When building with Foma, use the new lexc-align feature. 2015-06-12T23:12:14+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added lexicon filtering when pair-testing twolc rules. 2015-06-11T14:05:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected e-mail address, changed the template content of the transcription files from SMA to CRK, and at the same time corrected the direction of the code. Also added a default punctuation lexicon. 2015-06-09T21:29:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for easter eggs specific to alternative writing systems and other variants. Will help in debugging. 2015-06-07T19:44:39+00:00
> Replaced Latin a-z with more relevant alphabets. Not all of the langauges have the appropriate alphabets, so when doing error model development this file should be proofread. Small letters: all in normal orthography. Capital letters: The ones thay may occur word-initially. These are the letters we may suggest. 2015-06-05T01:34:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved specification of default weight and editing distance to the language specific Makefile. 2015-06-05T01:33:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] After a lot of experimenting, a moderate set of changes to the speller error models. The biggest change is that the alphabet for the edit distance error model is not taken from the acceptor anymore, but must be explicitly listed in the editdist.*.txt file. The suggestion speed is back to normal, but more work is needed re the interaction of the error model and corpus weights. 2015-06-05T00:48:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Prefixed all silent build strings for Hfst tools with H, for easier identification. 2015-06-04T09:46:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Commented out the old target for calculating unit weights (default weight for out-of-corpus word forms), and added a new which is basically the highest tropical weight + the ALPHA smoothing value. This is just the first step in further developing the suggestion ordering for the spellers. 2015-05-27T14:47:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a simple test to check a minimum suggestion speed for our test word nuvviDspeller. No speller should be released that does not pass this test. Additional and more elaborate tests should be added as well, this is just the very bare minimum in suggestion speed testing. 2015-05-25T13:56:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected typo in twolc compilation for foma (using hfst). 2015-05-24T13:26:20+00:00

< [Template merge - langs/und] Yaml testing is now working also when building with Foma. 2015-05-21T09:09:38+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed downcasing of derived short names. Made yaml testing output a bit more readable (hopefully). 2015-05-21T08:05:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More robust xfscript build code for hfst-xfst. Clean hfstol files. 2015-05-18T10:43:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Extended Foma support to alternate writing systems and orthographies. At the same time put to use a new idiom to handle multiple independent target variables / patterns, which will be useful in other contexts as well. The code was generalised using this new idiom, and effectively reduced to half the original code size, with much less duplicate code. 2015-05-15T09:07:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First working version of foma builds. The basic set of analysers and generators are built, but nothing else. A lot of changes to variables and build rules, including generalisations that save quite a few lines of code. 2015-05-11T15:42:10+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First steps to support building with Foma. Lexicon compilation is working, but note that Foma crashes on regexes in lexc. 2015-05-08T15:17:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Slightly more robust pair-testing with hfst. 2015-04-27T12:46:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected rsynk options also for the alternate writing system oxt's. 2015-04-27T09:30:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a build bug for MacVoikko, causing the final target to always be out of date. Regulated verbosity for zhfst targets. The twolc testing scripts now print a message when there is no test data. The Hfst twolc testing script properly detects when there is no test data, and exits with the SKIP (77) value. 2015-04-27T09:06:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternate writing systems for spellers. 2015-04-24T19:04:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Finally got all weighting to work as intended, including the no-sugg weights. 2015-04-23T06:53:23+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Further modularisation and improvements to weighted spellers. With hfst3 revision 4329, using a tab-separated tag reweighting file is working. 2015-04-21T11:47:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove usage tags when building spellers, speller tags were throwned out. 2015-04-16T09:55:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added an attempt at normalising the corpus-based weights towards a standard max upper weight, to allow a much higher weight for strings not to be suggested. Also split the processing of adding corpus-based weights and morphology weights into more steps - retaining each intermediate fst - to allow easier debugging of the weight assignments. 2015-04-16T08:24:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Xerox composition of weights and lexical fst. 2015-04-13T12:50:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved a script for cleaning weighting corpus to the core. Require new core. 2015-04-10T12:41:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bugs related to the new support for frequency-weighted spellers: missing checks for required tools. 2015-04-10T11:14:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Stupid copy-paste error turned the positive test into a negative. Now corrected. 2015-04-10T10:20:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Skip Xerox testing if no test data is found. Added comments. 2015-04-10T10:02:12+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added pair-test for hfst, improved pair-testing for Xerox' twolc. 2015-04-10T09:01:40+00:00
< Ignore txt files in speller dirs. 2015-04-09T11:49:00+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Add a huge weight to words tagged with +Use/SpellNoSugg. 2015-04-09T11:41:39+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for corpus-based (frequency) weighting of the speller fst's. Also reorganised where to specify the tag-based weights (and this is subject to change pending a bug fix in hfst-reweight). All languages are given a toy corpus, which can be replaced with a real one. This is finally the core of Tommi's dissertation applied to all languages. 2015-04-09T09:41:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] More robust testing for Xerox fst's - will properly report all generation fails. 2015-04-07T11:58:45+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected tests for nouns and propernouns. Now nouns behave correctly with hfst, and proper nouns have correct tags. 2015-04-07T07:14:20+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Modernised the generate-noun-lemmas.sh.in script, added similar scripts for adj, proper nouns and verbs. 2015-04-02T06:17:51+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Check that yaml testing is enabled before running yaml tests in test/tools/. 2015-04-01T11:17:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Require new version of the core, updated comments about Err tags. 2015-03-30T10:14:05+00:00
< +Err/Sub -> +Err/Orth, according to the meeting 19.3., with notes in http://divvun.no/doc/lang/common/ErrorTags.html. Commandos used for the tag change: 2015-03-29T09:34:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed CmpNP tags from downcase-derived-proper-strings.xfscript.in. 2015-03-19T07:36:08+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-14T10:56:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] When doing 'make clean', remove generated html files in the root dir. 2015-03-14T10:31:14+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed multichar definition of superfluous flag diacritics. 2015-03-13T13:57:48+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new directory named devtools/ to each language, with the idea that it should contain tools useful for development, but not necessarily suitable for automake testing. Initially it contains shell scripts to generate a table of generated word forms for each continuation lexicon. 2015-03-13T11:21:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed corpus names from tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/hfst/data/Makefile.am. It caused the build to stop with an error for all languages except FIN. 2015-03-12T08:50:49+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-12T08:28:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make building the abbr.txt configurable (default=no), check for the existence of src/morphology/stems/abbreviations.lexc, and error out if not found. 2015-03-12T06:31:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to include the new Makefile (r109076) in configure.ac. 2015-03-12T05:49:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for supporting corpus-based frequency weights, as per TommiP. 2015-03-11T17:45:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled weighting of speller fst's. Adjust weights and tags as needed. 2015-03-11T13:26:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for all languages to generate the abbr.txt file used by $GTCORE/scripts/preprocess. At the same time added initial support for compiling pmatch scripts into fst's for hfst-proc2, which is the future alternative to preprocess. 2015-03-09T15:13:06+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-09T10:43:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to remove some debug statements from the yaml test runner. Now cleaned. 2015-03-06T16:32:05+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-06T15:57:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved MWE tag processing into the core - we want this for many languages. 2015-03-06T15:30:22+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for a new type of yaml tests: speller acceptance testing. The basic idea is to just give a list of words and word constructions (compounds, derivations, etc) the speller should accept or reject, and let the yaml test bench verify whether this is actually the case. 2015-03-06T13:29:54+00:00
< Updated svn ignores. 2015-03-06T09:24:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Several changes to properly support all position-based +CmpN/XX tags: * moved tag path splitting and tag-to-flag conversion into separate regex files in the core. * added support for compiling and using the new regexes * added support for a new type +CmpN/Suff * added the required multichar symbols to the root.lexc files * increased required core version number 2015-03-05T15:48:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the yaml test bench when both hfst and xfst was enabled, but where only one type is built, e.g. for Apertium. 2015-03-05T14:12:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added build support for alternate orthographies: default fst's, dicts and oapha. 2015-03-04T15:51:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the wrong fst to be picked in certain cases, which caused the test script to fail. 2015-03-04T10:58:15+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A couple of changes related to testing: * require Python 3.3+ * require new gtcore * update YAML test runner to make SMS testing work as intended also with Xerox 2015-03-03T16:42:49+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for country/region specific proofing tools in configure.ac. 2015-03-02T13:16:18+00:00
< Update svn ignores. 2015-02-27T12:58:52+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] We do not support anything but the latest/newest Voikko now. 2015-02-27T12:44:31+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Finalised the basic multiple writing system support, by adding support for Oahpa and dictionary fst's. 2015-02-27T11:23:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configuration flag to enable two-step compose-intersect. In most cases this will not make any difference, but for some languages it will correct a bug in compose-intersect that would otherwise create a bad fst, and for other languages it will make the operation much slower without changing the fst. Disabled by default, whether it is useful must be tested in each case / language. 2015-02-27T09:21:50+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected errors in hfst compilation of alternative writing system fst's. 2015-02-26T18:08:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added test runners for genation and analysis tests only for the descriptive fst. 2015-02-26T12:39:20+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Compilation of the default set of fst's with alternate writing systems working. 2015-02-26T08:41:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] First step in adding support for alternate writing systems and orthographies: adding variables to configure.ac. Removed the variable LO_min_version, it isn't used. 2015-02-25T06:54:29+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Split the m4/ax_python_module.m4 file, it contained mostly java autotools stuff. Improved the message to update the gtcore. 2015-02-24T15:20:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added the make-optional-hyph-tags filter to the generators. Fixes bug #1914. 2015-02-12T22:51:16+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make use of the new remove-adv_comp filter. Require new core and newest hfst. 2015-02-12T15:09:33+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Put to use the make-optional-adv_comp filter. 2015-02-12T11:34:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Don't build xerox fst's within the Apertium dir tree - no need for it. 2015-02-12T11:21:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Require new core because of new filters. Use hfst-optimized-lookup in the yaml testing (but only if possible), this should speed up hfst testing quite a bit. 2015-02-11T21:49:36+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Put the new optional minip filter to use, and increased required gtcore version. 2015-02-11T04:54:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced all instances of sub and lexsub filters with the new, generated error filters. 2015-02-10T20:56:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for extracting error tags and constructing filters for manipulating error strings and tags. Updated required version of gtcore. 2015-02-10T14:43:26+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Remove variant tags in disamb analyser. 2015-02-10T13:49:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Xerox fst's are irrelevant to Apertium, don't even try to build them. 2015-02-10T09:15:35+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Use the new make-optional-v1-tags filter for apertium generators. 2015-02-09T19:52:03+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to include the new regex in the src file listing in the previous commit. 2015-02-09T18:05:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected dictionary generators to require a variant tag except for +v1, which is optional. 2015-02-09T17:43:07+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Removed 'invert net' from a couple of more instances. 2015-02-09T17:01:44+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Treat Hfst and Xerox the same during *tmp.Xfst and *.Xfst build - invert both only in the last step when going from tmp to non-tmp fst (invert the analyser for hfst, the generator for xfst). This should remove one more confusing difference between the two. 2015-02-09T15:34:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Check that we have at least Python3.1 when enabling Apertium, error out if not. Also add AM check for hfst-optimized-lookup. 2015-02-09T14:47:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A small, functionally equivalent change: from suffix rule to pattern rule. 2015-01-30T16:52:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Now +CmpN/Pref is correctly supported (earlier it was treated as +CmpN/First). 2015-01-30T13:01:24+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected fst file reference in test shell script. 2015-01-29T20:06:18+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected source file reference in test shell script. 2015-01-29T19:07:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Changes to a couple of Makefile.am files to fix issues with 'make dist'. 2015-01-29T09:52:41+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] The last part of the CmpN location restriction flag diacritics added. 2015-01-29T08:01:20+00:00
< Makefile.in does not belong in svn. 2015-01-28T08:57:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Code cleanup: no use for the M4 part - the null alternative did not work. 2015-01-27T20:11:06+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Finally nailed all combinations of fst compilator and lexicon minimisation - now downcasing of derived proper nouns is working as it should again for both Xerox, Hfst hyperminimised and Hfst normal lexc compilation. 2015-01-27T15:38:42+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] +CmpN/Only supported, first steps in tag splitting taken. 2015-01-27T13:15:02+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Moved code common to all yaml testrunner shell scripts to an include file in GTCORE to avoid code duplication and reduce the risk for introducing bugs. This requires the newest version of the CORE. Because of the inclusion, I had to rename the test runner to .sh.in, and added autoconf processing of it. Also added a test file for testing the base speller fst (it must be tailored to each language of course). 2015-01-26T15:33:56+00:00
< Special svn:ignore on src/orthography/. 2015-01-26T10:34:37+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Last change to get hyperminimisation to produce the correct output: made the derived-proper downcase script being processed by autoconf, so that we can require a symbol in a certain context, and at the same time in the end let the symbol be empty if not needed. 2015-01-22T11:09:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added optional flag diacritic inserted by Hfst hyperminimisation. This resolves the remaining cases of errors after the hfst team fixed a bug in lexc compilation with hyperminimisation turned on. Since it is optional, it does not make any harm when using Xerox or when not using hyperminimisation. 2015-01-22T08:42:30+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added xerox variable flag-is-epsilon to the tag reorder regex. This fixes most of the cases of errors after the hyperminimisation bug was fixed in hfst-lexc. The remaining errors must be fixed in the downcase-derived-proper regex. 2015-01-22T07:21:19+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added more silent builds for hfst tools. 2015-01-20T20:37:55+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added conversion of tags to flag diacritica for position-restricting tags. These are currently used in sma, sme, smj and sje. Together with some additions to the R lexicon, the tags will finally do what they are meant to do for hfst-based spellers. 2015-01-20T09:16:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added Multichar symbol definitions for flag diacritica controlling compounding based on position tags. Done for most langs, the symbols will be ignored if not used. 2015-01-19T21:29:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] New: added example test file for the fstspeller fst file (starting point for foma and hfst spellers). 2015-01-14T18:15:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed: errors in the yaml test runner when the fst has a suffix 'hfst'. 2015-01-14T18:04:59+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed: directory and fst names in the yaml runner shell script. 2015-01-14T17:28:34+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for yaml tests for speller fst's. 2015-01-14T17:08:17+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for Xerox fst's in tools/spellcheckers/fstbased, mainly to help in debugging hfst. Turned out to be very useful. 2015-01-13T23:44:01+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Improved comments to make the lemma generation script easier to adapt. 2015-01-13T15:42:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Additions to generate the inverted fst's, to enable symmetric yaml testing. 2015-01-13T06:24:21+00:00
< Updated svn:ignore's. 2015-01-12T21:52:28+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed: order of filter application was wrong, causing all Use/-Spell forms to be included in the spellers. 2015-01-12T21:41:21+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Make sure the easter egg is rebuilt every time the fst is rebuilt. 2015-01-09T10:15:40+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed: The MacVoikko target contained one subtarget that built even when spellers were not enabled, and thus failed because of a missing dependency. 2015-01-08T10:08:05+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] A number of changes to make the MacVoikko.service build cleanly with proper dependency tracking. Also a bit safer cleaning. 2015-01-07T11:10:56+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed: The MacVoikko target was missing from noinst_DATA, thus it was not built. 2015-01-07T09:42:25+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Two template merges: * Added initial support for building language-specific macosx systemwide spellers. [r105104] * Added strip function to get rid of extra spaces, resolves bug in abbr.txt build. [r104185] 2015-01-05T16:11:58+00:00
< [Template merge - langs/und] Expanded the source file base for building the abbr file, more like the old infra. Included lexc files in src/morphology/ in the abbr file making. 2014-11-19T11:45:17+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Only delete (aka 'make clean') generated corpus files used for weighting if such files exist. Removes a very dangerous 'rm -rf .*' command. 2014-11-18T07:37:22+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed bug in the phonology building that caused extra source files not to be compiled. 2014-11-14T10:19:32+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Removing Use/LexSub strings from all normative fst's. Fixes bug #1904. 2014-11-11T09:48:28+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added support for turning off building of vislcg3/syntactic tools. 2014-11-04T10:55:58+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Improvements and corrections in the README file. 2014-10-28T23:23:39+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Changed Hfst configuration: * moved xerox check before hfst check to ... * automatically enable hfst if the Xerox tools are not found * moved minimum version requirement definition to configure.ac * removed hfst-foma requirement, instead checking for all required tools * removed path check for obsolete hfst tools * improved hfst configuration messages * updated the summary text to reflect that hfst is automatically enabled These changes should ease configuration on systems without Xerox. 2014-10-28T22:27:33+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrected names of compiled twolc files in test/src/phonology/pair-test*.sh.in. We need to use the 'compose' fst because compiled twolc files are not treated the same as other fst's. We can't just skip the new lookup-friendly filenames either, because morphophonological rules can be written using xfscript, in which case the lookup renaming (and inversion) is essential. 2014-10-27T15:11:42+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrrected references to the new lookup style fst names. Fixes broken inituppercase tests. Updated config header in initcap yaml file correspondingly. 2014-10-23T09:15:10+00:00
< Update ignores for src/morphology/. 2014-10-23T08:28:02+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Now both general and language-pair specific relabelling using regexes are supported, in addition to using relabel files. The regexes allow context-dependent and multisymbol changes, whereas the relabel files only cover 1:1 mappings of single symbols. The actual change was to add support for regex files in the language-pair independent processing. The tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/README.txt file was more or less completely rewritten to better document the filenames being recognised, and how they should be used. 2014-10-23T06:15:55+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Retain the regular non-optimised hfst analyser for easy paradigm generation using a regex plus composition. 2014-10-21T11:02:19+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug in the Apertium build that blocked building of AP-tagged analysers. 2014-10-20T19:14:52+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Make sure there is always an apertium analyser for 'und' if nothing else. 2014-10-20T14:41:04+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Do not remove homonymy tags from the apertium fst's. Also simplified the automatic conversion by moving all non-automatic changes to a separate file, run as a sort of tag conversion postprocessing. Updated the tagset/README.txt file to contain info aobut the manually maintained postprocessing relabel file. Added an initial postprocessing relabel file containing word boundary and homonymy tag changes. 2014-10-14T19:22:50+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Do not remove homonymy tags from the regular analysers. 2014-10-14T14:39:21+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug in building Oahpa generators - orig-lang tags were not removed. Clean *.hfstol files in tools/mt/apertium/. 2014-10-14T11:15:36+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Moved Apertium tagset creation and relabeling from src/tagsets/ to tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. This should fix building of apertium fst's for fin, smn. 2014-10-10T14:28:42+00:00
< [Template merge * 2 - und] 1) Improved test for gnu awk. 2) Renamed AWK to GAWK in relevant places to get around another AWK test. Now gawk is found properly in all cases. 2014-10-09T11:02:07+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Require newest core to force people to upgrade to get an important bugfix. 2014-10-07T14:07:39+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug in the core for generated regexes - a reserved char was not escaped. Required core version bumped. 2014-10-06T07:34:07+00:00
< Do not require a space at the end of the date string! 2014-10-06T06:11:42+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Hfst 3.8.0 is out, with a number of important bug fixes and improvements, including new options required to make our code build properly. 2014-10-04T07:16:41+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Several changes to accomodate a downcaseerror variant of the L2 error fst for Oahpa: * added configure.ac option --enable-downcaseerror (independent of the L2 opt) * a number of changes to the build instructions for Oahpa to support the new fst * made the error fst compilation independent of whether an L2 twolc/xfscript file is used - if not, it will just use the ordinary twolc/xfscript file. This way it is possible to build a downcaseerror fst without starting L2 development. * svn-copied regexes from the old to the new infra, including to the core * increased gtcore version number and required version number due to new regexes 2014-10-02T14:34:27+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrected wrong filenames and file references that blocked the oahpa L2 build. 2014-10-02T06:39:24+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Tagset relabeling didn't work for xfst files, now it does. Also generalised the use of relabel files (for use with hfst-relabel). 2014-10-02T06:24:06+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of hfst's with alternative tagsets, now that the *.hfst files are not in optimised lookup format. Silenced regex compilation. 2014-10-01T14:44:20+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Last part of the lookup & composition cleanup: phonetics and phonology now covered. Now all non-lexical and non-filter files have a suffix .compose.* or .lookup.* depending on their intended use, and they are all properly inverted where needed (i.e. only for Xerox' lookup tool). There might still be source files to clean, but that is a separate step. 2014-09-30T22:55:10+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrected a couple of cases where old filenames were still used, and thus broke compilation. Also improved filtering of transcriptors, and constructed transcriptor target names dynamically based on the source files. 2014-09-30T21:30:41+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Xfscript and lookup cleanup: now we explicitly build files made for lookup and composition marked in the filenames. This is done for hyphenation and for orthography, phonology and phonetics still to be done. From now on there should be no need to use invert as part of the xfscript code - DON'T DO IT! All targets updated to use the new filenames. Removed inversion from the hyphenation xfscript. 2014-09-30T19:54:37+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Use explicit pipe mode with hfst-xfst. 2014-09-30T10:50:52+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Moved Apertium target language specification from configure.ac to tools/mt/apertium/Makefile.am. Changed the target filename construction to better follow the Apertium naming scheme. Fixed a bug introduced about four weeks ago that destroyed the dependency chain (due to a bug/fragileness in GNU make). 2014-09-30T10:37:59+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Cleaned up building of target fst's using the lookup-include.am file. Now all hfst transducers in optimised lookup format have the suffix .hfstol, and optimisation should not be hidden or implisit anymore. All test scripts should be updated as well. Also move all common targets from src/Makefile.am to am-shared/src-dir-include.am and sub-included AM files. This cleans up the src/ dir Makefile.am quite a lot. 2014-09-29T21:22:26+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added support for additional local lexc files not part of the lexical fst. 2014-09-29T11:51:44+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Several changes to clean up the mess with the transcriptors: * moved transcriptor final builds from src/ to src/transcriptions/ * renamed transcriptor source files and targets * streamlined transcriptor compilation to use lexc-include and lookup-include * also silenced xfst in lookup-include.am 2014-09-26T09:08:20+00:00
< [Template merge * 2 - und] There were a couple of issues in the previous commit: * vpath directive didn't work reliably * L1 and L2 variabless were declared for easy merging, but in a way that AM didn't like * forgot to change the name of the lexical fst in the filter processing 2014-09-24T12:17:05+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added support for filters written in lexc and xfscript. Renamed variables and added a lexc-include.am file to support general lexc compilation. 2014-09-22T12:19:48+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed an unfortunate AM syntax error that blocked Automake, and thus all builds. 2014-09-20T10:04:31+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Three template updates at once: * Cleaned the filter build files even more. Now only local / language specific regex source files need to be listed in the local Makefile.am. * Fixed a problem with MT filter compilation that only revealed itself in sme. * Another filter build cleanup: all filter regexes in core are now built for all languages. One obsolete filter was removed. 2014-09-18T17:43:37+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added a new filter to the filter compilation. Used the new filter to build correct fst's for dictionary analysis and generation. Increased the version number of the required gtd core version, due to the new and required filter in the core. 2014-09-18T07:45:56+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Major cleanup of filter and tagset compilation: * moved all non-local data and build instructions into am-shared/ * created dir-specific am-include files * clean use of regex-include.am * removed sme-specific source files from tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/Makefile.am * switched the apertium filter use to use the one built in src/filters/ instead of rebuilding it 2014-09-17T11:52:42+00:00
< [Template merge - und] analyser-oahpa-gt-desc should be analyser-oahpa-gt-norm. Now renamed. 2014-09-15T17:03:46+00:00
< [Template merge - und] The listbased speller fst is now generated properly using both Xerox and Hfst. 2014-09-15T13:00:26+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Fixed a logical error that turned off all hfst spellers. Renamed a variable. 2014-09-15T10:03:01+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Only build Apertium tagsets in tools/mt/ if Apertium is turned on. 2014-09-15T08:41:49+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrected a syntax error in the src_disamb-include.am file. Moved all fst trimming of general interest from tools-spellcheckers-listbased to tools-spellcheckers. Made the configuration so that list-based spellers will only compile if configured to build Hunspell. Also tried to make the configuration of other spellers such that they are automatically off when spellers are off. 2014-09-15T06:04:55+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Downcasing of the initial letter of derived proper nouns (Pariisi -> pariisilainen) is now finally working with Hfst. It requires Hfst svn rev. 4000. 2014-09-12T10:36:40+00:00
< Updated svn:ignore's. 2014-09-08T21:40:37+00:00
< [Template merge - und] The first major step for adding support for generating list-based spellers such as Hunspell and the PLX (Polderland/MS Word) spellers. The conversion is not trivial, since we try to control compounding according to the linguistic specifiation in the lexicon (using tags). Although PLX is only for three Sámi languages, Hunspell conversion should be useful for all languages in our infrastructure. No real Hunspell or PLX files produced yet, only prerequisite fst's. - At the same time fixed a glitch in the version checking of VislCG3 that would turn off support for CG files now that the vislcg3 svn revision number has turned 10 000. 2014-09-08T21:33:54+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added support for local overrides of the base speller fst. 2014-09-05T20:55:33+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Generalised and simplified the code for building oxt's - no more hard-coded filenames. Now the LO-voikko versions supported as well as the platforms are just defined in two variables, and the rest follows from there. The build code also handles cases of unsupported combinations of voikko versions and platforms. Also silenced the build quite a lot in non-verbose mode. 2014-09-04T08:23:38+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Switched to universal binary build for the LO41 voikko OXT. 2014-09-02T10:13:12+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Made the hfst optimised lookup file format explicit by using the .hfstol suffix, and by optimising files for lookup in a separate build step, instead of implicitly as before. So far only for tools/mt/apertium/, but more will come. Removed the removal of semantic tags - they are already optional, which should be more flexible and robust. 2014-08-27T11:58:27+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Made speller minimisation default to yes, specified where to push weights. 2014-08-26T07:08:16+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added --encode-weights to determinise and minimise. This fixed the never-ending compilation of Finnish spellers. 2014-08-25T14:32:36+00:00
< [Template merge - und] The optimisations that worked for Greenlandic didn't work for Finnish, potentially due to Finnish being corpus-weighted and thus posing more challenges to determinisation and minimisation. Because of this the Greenlandic optimisation is now rolled into the configuration option --enable-minimised-spellers, OFF by default. 2014-08-22T17:40:51+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added size and speed optimisations to the speller compilation process: remove-epsilons, push-weights, determinise and minimise. Together this made the KAL speller *much* smaller and *much* faster. It is now as fast and small as any other fst-based speller. 2014-08-22T09:32:19+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Hyperminimisation seems to be stable now, and I have added it as a standard configuration option. Also added autoconf support for the preliminary tool hfst-proc2, to facilitate easier testing of the tokeniser/analyser. 2014-08-21T08:51:07+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Updated the tagset targets to support Xerox fst's, and tagset replacement using regexes instead of the hfst-only relabel tool. Now all languages can get localised analysis and generation tags by adding a regex file and specifying a few targets. 2014-08-19T16:43:15+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added build step to explicitly convert hfst transducers to optimised lookup format. Whitespace changes in the silent rule variables. Included the new lookup-include file in src-dir-include.am. 2014-08-19T11:34:06+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Preparations for better handling of lookup & testing of free-standing lexc and rewrite rule transducers: added build rules to do inversion of fst's intended for lookup. 2014-08-19T07:53:39+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Added a test dir for the upcoming hfst-based tokeniser. 2014-08-19T07:01:24+00:00
< [Template merge - und] Corrected some paths to enable VPATH building of spellers. Added support for retaining intermediate files when building using "make --debug". 2014-08-15T06:56:35+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Yaml testing is now working also when building with Foma. 2015-05-21T08:34:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed downcasing of derived short names. Made yaml testing output a bit more readable (hopefully). 2015-05-21T07:49:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust xfscript build code for hfst-xfst. Clean hfstol files. 2015-05-18T10:16:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Extended Foma support to alternate writing systems and orthographies. At the same time put to use a new idiom to handle multiple independent target variables / patterns, which will be useful in other contexts as well. The code was generalised using this new idiom, and effectively reduced to half the original code size, with much less duplicate code. 2015-05-15T08:52:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First working version of foma builds. The basic set of analysers and generators are built, but nothing else. A lot of changes to variables and build rules, including generalisations that save quite a few lines of code. 2015-05-11T14:48:32+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First steps to support building with Foma. Lexicon compilation is working, but note that Foma crashes on regexes in lexc. 2015-05-08T15:00:46+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Slightly more robust pair-testing with hfst. 2015-04-27T12:40:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected rsynk options also for the alternate writing system oxt's. 2015-04-27T09:23:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a build bug for MacVoikko, causing the final target to always be out of date. Regulated verbosity for zhfst targets. The twolc testing scripts now print a message when there is no test data. The Hfst twolc testing script properly detects when there is no test data, and exits with the SKIP (77) value. 2015-04-27T08:55:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for alternate writing systems for spellers. 2015-04-24T17:41:51+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finally got all weighting to work as intended, including the no-sugg weights. 2015-04-23T06:38:45+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Further modularisation and improvements to weighted spellers. With hfst3 revision 4329, using a tab-separated tag reweighting file is working. 2015-04-21T11:29:41+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Do not remove usage tags when building spellers, speller tags were throwned out. 2015-04-16T09:45:40+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added an attempt at normalising the corpus-based weights towards a standard max upper weight, to allow a much higher weight for strings not to be suggested. Also split the processing of adding corpus-based weights and morphology weights into more steps - retaining each intermediate fst - to allow easier debugging of the weight assignments. 2015-04-16T08:15:08+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Xerox composition of weights and lexical fst. 2015-04-13T12:45:05+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved a script for cleaning weighting corpus to the core. Require new core. 2015-04-10T12:30:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed bugs related to the new support for frequency-weighted spellers: missing checks for required tools. 2015-04-10T10:55:33+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Stupid copy-paste error turned the positive test into a negative. Now corrected. 2015-04-10T10:14:11+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Skip Xerox testing if no test data is found. Added comments. 2015-04-10T09:45:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added pair-test for hfst, improved pair-testing for Xerox' twolc. 2015-04-10T08:34:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Add a huge weight to words tagged with +Use/SpellNoSugg. 2015-04-09T11:35:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for corpus-based (frequency) weighting of the speller fst's. Also reorganised where to specify the tag-based weights (and this is subject to change pending a bug fix in hfst-reweight). All languages are given a toy corpus, which can be replaced with a real one. This is finally the core of Tommi's dissertation applied to all languages. 2015-04-09T09:26:35+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] More robust testing for Xerox fst's - should properly report all generation fails. 2015-04-07T12:35:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected tests for nouns and propernouns. Now nouns behave correctly with hfst, and proper nouns have correct tags. 2015-04-07T07:38:15+00:00
> +Prop tag for propernouns. 2015-04-06T12:35:37+00:00
> One more failing test. 2015-04-02T06:46:04+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Modernised the generate-noun-lemmas.sh.in script, added similar scripts for adj, proper nouns and verbs. 2015-04-02T06:07:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Check that yaml testing is enabled before running yaml tests in test/tools/. 2015-04-01T11:07:41+00:00
> Corrected xfst script syntax errors (one can’t combine <- and (<-) within the same [] clause. Since there is no overlapping paths, using .o. instead should be fine. 2015-04-01T08:40:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Require new version of the core, updated comments about Err tags. 2015-03-30T10:05:11+00:00
> Updated documentation. 2015-03-27T11:33:52+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed CmpNP tags from downcase-derived-proper-strings.xfscript.in. 2015-03-19T07:33:07+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] When doing 'make clean', remove generated html files in the root dir. 2015-03-14T10:23:58+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed multichar definition of superfluous flag diacritics. 2015-03-13T13:47:40+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a new directory named devtools/ to each language, with the idea that it should contain tools useful for development, but not necessarily suitable for automake testing. Initially it contains shell scripts to generate a table of generated word forms for each continuation lexicon. 2015-03-13T10:24:25+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Removed corpus names from tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/hfst/data/Makefile.am. It caused the build to stop with an error for all languages except FIN. 2015-03-12T08:44:38+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make building the abbr.txt configurable (default=no), check for the existence of src/morphology/stems/abbreviations.lexc, and error out if not found. 2015-03-12T06:26:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to include the new Makefile (r109076) in configure.ac. 2015-03-12T05:42:59+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Preparations for supporting corpus-based frequency weights, as per TommiP. 2015-03-11T17:28:31+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Enabled weighting of speller fst's. Adjust weights and tags as needed. 2015-03-11T13:21:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for all languages to generate the abbr.txt file used by $GTCORE/scripts/preprocess. At the same time added initial support for compiling pmatch scripts into fst's for hfst-proc2, which is the future alternative to preprocess. 2015-03-09T14:52:03+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to remove some debug statements from the yaml test runner. Now cleaned. 2015-03-06T16:21:47+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved MWE tag processing into the core - we want this for many languages. 2015-03-06T15:24:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for a new type of yaml tests: speller acceptance testing. The basic idea is to just give a list of words and word constructions (compounds, derivations, etc) the speller should accept or reject, and let the yaml test bench verify whether this is actually the case. 2015-03-06T13:07:55+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Several changes to properly support all position-based +CmpN/XX tags: * moved tag path splitting and tag-to-flag conversion into separate regex files in the core. * added support for compiling and using the new regexes * added support for a new type +CmpN/Suff * added the required multichar symbols to the root.lexc files * increased required core version number 2015-03-05T15:13:56+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug in the yaml test bench when both hfst and xfst was enabled, but where only one type is built, e.g. for Apertium. 2015-03-05T14:08:15+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added build support for alternate orthographies: default fst's, dicts and oapha. 2015-03-04T15:22:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fixed a bug that caused the wrong fst to be picked in certain cases, which caused the test script to fail. 2015-03-04T10:51:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] A couple of changes related to testing: * require Python 3.3+ * require new gtcore * update YAML test runner to make SMS testing work as intended also with Xerox 2015-03-03T16:31:36+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for country/region specific proofing tools in configure.ac. 2015-03-02T12:50:54+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] We do not support anything but the latest/newest Voikko now. 2015-02-27T12:40:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finalised the basic multiple writing system support, by adding support for Oahpa and dictionary fst's. 2015-02-27T11:12:23+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added a configuration flag to enable two-step compose-intersect. In most cases this will not make any difference, but for some languages it will correct a bug in compose-intersect that would otherwise create a bad fst, and for other languages it will make the operation much slower without changing the fst. Disabled by default, whether it is useful must be tested in each case / language. 2015-02-27T09:11:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected errors in hfst compilation of alternative writing system fst's. 2015-02-26T17:54:48+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added test runners for genation and analysis tests only for the descriptive fst. 2015-02-26T12:28:20+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Compilation of the default set of fst's with alternate writing systems working. 2015-02-26T08:30:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] First step in adding support for alternate writing systems and orthographies: adding variables to configure.ac. Removed the variable LO_min_version, it isn't used. 2015-02-25T06:44:28+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Split the m4/ax_python_module.m4 file, it contained mostly java autotools stuff. Improved the message to update the gtcore. 2015-02-24T15:14:55+00:00
> The xeroxscript files are generated (as are the corresponding hfstscript files). They should not be in svn. Instead, the svn ignore script should be updated. 2015-02-15T12:33:42+00:00
> xeroxscript 2015-02-15T12:20:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added the make-optional-hyph-tags filter to the generators. Fixes bug #1914. 2015-02-12T22:25:31+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Make use of the new remove-adv_comp filter. Require new core and newest hfst. 2015-02-12T15:05:06+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Put to use the make-optional-adv_comp filter. 2015-02-12T11:31:19+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Don't build xerox fst's within the Apertium dir tree - no need for it. 2015-02-12T11:19:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Require new core because of new filters. Use hfst-optimized-lookup in the yaml testing (but only if possible), this should speed up hfst testing quite a bit. 2015-02-11T21:35:12+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Put the new optional minip filter to use, and increased required gtcore version. 2015-02-10T23:03:18+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Replaced all instances of sub and lexsub filters with the new, generated error filters. 2015-02-10T20:36:01+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added support for extracting error tags and constructing filters for manipulating error strings and tags. Updated required version of gtcore. 2015-02-10T14:38:16+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Remove variant tags in disamb analyser. 2015-02-10T13:47:44+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Xerox fst's are irrelevant to Apertium, don't even try to build them. 2015-02-10T09:13:18+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Forgot to include the new regex in the src file listing in the previous commit. 2015-02-09T17:56:22+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Corrected dictionary generators to require a variant tag except for +v1, which is optional. 2015-02-09T17:40:34+00:00

> remove the tag rare. 2015-01-27T19:45:19+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Finally nailed all combinations of fst compilator and lexicon minimisation - now downcasing of derived proper nouns is working as it should again for both Xerox, Hfst hyperminimised and Hfst normal lexc compilation. 2015-01-27T15:17:43+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] +CmpN/Only supported, first steps in tag splitting taken. 2015-01-26T20:43:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Moved code common to all yaml testrunner shell scripts to an include file in GTCORE to avoid code duplication and reduce the risk for introducing bugs. This requires the newest version of the CORE. Because of the inclusion, I had to rename the test runner to .sh.in, and added autoconf processing of it. Also added a test file for testing the base speller fst (it must be tailored to each language of course). 2015-01-26T13:52:29+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] Last change to get hyperminimisation to produce the correct output: made the derived-proper downcase script being processed by autoconf, so that we can require a symbol in a certain context, and at the same time in the end let the symbol be empty if not needed. 2015-01-22T10:38:50+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added optional flag diacritic inserted by Hfst hyperminimisation. This resolves the remaining cases of errors after the hfst team fixed a bug in lexc compilation with hyperminimisation turned on. Since it is optional, it does not make any harm when using Xerox or when not using hyperminimisation. 2015-01-22T08:36:09+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added xerox variable flag-is-epsilon to the tag reorder regex. This fixes most of the cases of errors after the hyperminimisation bug was fixed in hfst-lexc. The remaining errors must be fixed in the downcase-derived-proper regex. 2015-01-22T07:15:43+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Corrected names of compiled twolc files in test/src/phonology/pair-test*.sh.in. We need to use the 'compose' fst because compiled twolc files are not treated the same as other fst's. We can't just skip the new lookup-friendly filenames either, because morphophonological rules can be written using xfscript, in which case the lookup renaming (and inversion) is essential. 2014-10-27T14:00:29+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Now both general and language-pair specific relabelling using regexes are supported, in addition to using relabel files. The regexes allow context-dependent and multisymbol changes, whereas the relabel files only cover 1:1 mappings of single symbols. The actual change was to add support for regex files in the language-pair independent processing. The tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/README.txt file was more or less completely rewritten to better document the filenames being recognised, and how they should be used. 2014-10-23T06:03:36+00:00

This way it is possible to build a downcaseerror fst without starting L2 development. * svn-copied regexes from the old to the new infra, including to the core * increased gtcore version number and required version number due to new regexes 2014-10-02T14:10:42+00:00
> The source files must be specified to be included in distros, and regexes must also be listed to be compiled and thus become available for further processing. 2014-10-02T10:47:13+00:00
> add 2014-10-02T10:17:50+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected wrong filenames and file references that blocked the oahpa L2 build. 2014-10-02T06:33:23+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Tagset relabeling didn't work for xfst files, now it does. Also generalised the use of relabel files (for use with hfst-relabel). 2014-10-02T06:18:41+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of hfst's with alternative tagsets, now that the *.hfst files are not in optimised lookup format. Silenced regex compilation. 2014-10-01T14:38:45+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Last part of the lookup & composition cleanup: phonetics and phonology now covered. Now all non-lexical and non-filter files have a suffix .compose.* or .lookup.* depending on their intended use, and they are all properly inverted where needed (i.e. only for Xerox' lookup tool). There might still be source files to clean, but that is a separate step. 2014-09-30T22:43:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a couple of cases where old filenames were still used, and thus broke compilation. Also improved filtering of transcriptors, and constructed transcriptor target names dynamically based on the source files. 2014-09-30T21:22:42+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Xfscript and lookup cleanup: now we explicitly build files made for lookup and composition marked in the filenames. This is done for hyphenation and for orthography, phonology and phonetics still to be done. From now on there should be no need to use invert as part of the xfscript code - DON'T DO IT! All targets updated to use the new filenames. Removed inversion from the hyphenation xfscript. 2014-09-30T19:35:01+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Moved Apertium target language specification from configure.ac to tools/mt/apertium/Makefile.am. Changed the target filename construction to better follow the Apertium naming scheme. Fixed a bug introduced about four weeks ago that destroyed the dependency chain (due to a bug/fragileness in GNU make). 2014-09-30T09:42:32+00:00
> derivations a la gt 2014-09-29T20:04:15+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Cleaned up building of target fst's using the lookup-include.am file. Now all hfst transducers in optimised lookup format have the suffix .hfstol, and optimisation should not be hidden or implisit anymore. All test scripts should be updated as well. Also move all common targets from src/Makefile.am to am-shared/src-dir-include.am and sub-included AM files. This cleans up the src/ dir Makefile.am quite a lot. 2014-09-29T15:59:02+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Several changes to clean up the mess with the transcriptors: * moved transcriptor final builds from src/ to src/transcriptions/ * renamed transcriptor source files and targets * streamlined transcriptor compilation to use lexc-include and lookup-include * also silenced xfst in lookup-include.am 2014-09-26T08:25:41+00:00
> [Template merge - und] There were a couple of issues in the previous commit: * vpath directive didn't work reliably * L1 and L2 variabless were declared for easy merging, but in a way that AM didn't like * forgot to change the name of the lexical fst in the filter processing 2014-09-24T11:47:53+00:00
> Resolving L1 and L2 in src/morphology/Makefile.am 2014-09-23T19:25:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Several changes to accomodate L2 (language learner) analysers for Oahpa: * removed silent build instructions from twolc-include (they are taken from the   silent-build-include instead) * added support for compiling L2 phonology/twolc files when configured to * renamed $(GTLANG)-lexc.?fst to just lexicon.?fst. * added support for the error analyser in src_oahpa-include.am * added configure support for the L2 analyser (off by default) * added support for building the L2 lexical fst using L2 source files * added variables a.o. to support specifying L2 source files in src/morphology/ 2014-09-23T09:38:14+00:00
> conversion to gt standards, 2014-09-22T17:02:23+00:00
> Added linewraps where possible to make the code more readable (i.e. everywhere except when the generated code/script is given as input to Xerox' lexc). Renamed two file references to correspond to what is generated after the latest changes in the filter dir. 2014-09-22T12:07:48+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for filters written in lexc and xfscript. Renamed variables and added a lexc-include.am file to support general lexc compilation. 2014-09-22T12:02:22+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Three template updates at once: * Cleaned the filter build files even more. Now only local / language specific regex source files need to be listed in the local Makefile.am. * Fixed a problem with MT filter compilation that only revealed itself in sme. * Another filter build cleanup: all filter regexes in core are now built for all languages. One obsolete filter was removed. 2014-09-22T11:19:33+00:00

> Tag conversion, step two, almost there. 2014-09-18T10:11:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a new filter to the filter compilation. Used the new filter to build correct fst's for dictionary analysis and generation. Increased the version number of the required gtd core version, due to the new and required filter in the core. 2014-09-18T07:33:48+00:00
> Initial plamk -> gt tag conversion. 2014-09-18T02:03:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Major cleanup of filter and tagset compilation: * moved all non-local data and build instructions into am-shared/ * created dir-specific am-include files * clean use of regex-include.am * removed sme-specific source files from tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/Makefile.am * switched the apertium filter use to use the one built in src/filters/ instead of rebuilding it 2014-09-17T11:02:53+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Fixed a logical error that turned off all hfst spellers. Renamed a variable. 2014-09-15T09:54:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Only build Apertium tagsets in tools/mt/ if Apertium is turned on. 2014-09-15T08:36:07+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a syntax error in the src_disamb-include.am file. Moved all fst trimming of general interest from tools-spellcheckers-listbased to tools-spellcheckers. Made the configuration so that list-based spellers will only compile if configured to build Hunspell. Also tried to make the configuration of other spellers such that they are automatically off when spellers are off. 2014-09-15T05:58:27+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Downcasing of the initial letter of derived proper nouns (Pariisi -> pariisilainen) is now finally working with Hfst. It requires Hfst svn rev. 4000. Batch two. 2014-09-12T09:44:24+00:00

> [Template merge - und] The first major step for adding support for generating list-based spellers such as Hunspell and the PLX (Polderland/MS Word) spellers. The conversion is not trivial, since we try to control compounding according to the linguistic specifiation in the lexicon (using tags). Although PLX is only for three Sámi languages, Hunspell conversion should be useful for all languages in our infrastructure. No real Hunspell or PLX files produced yet, only prerequisite fst's. - At the same time fixed a glitch in the version checking of VislCG3 that would turn off support for CG files now that the vislcg3 svn revision number has turned 10 000. 2014-09-08T20:31:14+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for local overrides of the base speller fst. 2014-09-05T20:14:28+00:00
> Notes of today's SamEst meeting. 2014-09-04T11:55:29+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Generalised and simplified the code for building oxt's - no more hard-coded filenames. Now the LO-voikko versions supported as well as the platforms are just defined in two variables, and the rest follows from there. The build code also handles cases of unsupported combinations of voikko versions and platforms. Also silenced the build quite a lot in non-verbose mode. 2014-09-04T07:58:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Switched to universal binary build for the LO41 voikko OXT. 2014-09-02T10:02:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made the hfst optimised lookup file format explicit by using the .hfstol suffix, and by optimising files for lookup in a separate build step, instead of implicitly as before. So far only for tools/mt/apertium/, but more will come. Removed the removal of semantic tags - they are already optional, which should be more flexible and robust. 2014-08-27T11:52:53+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made speller minimisation default to yes, specified where to push weights. 2014-08-26T07:02:38+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added --encode-weights to determinise and minimise. This fixed the never-ending compilation of Finnish spellers. 2014-08-25T14:16:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] The optimisations that worked for Greenlandic didn't work for Finnish, potentially due to Finnish being corpus-weighted and thus posing more challenges to determinisation and minimisation. Because of this the Greenlandic optimisation is now rolled into the configuration option --enable-minimised-spellers, OFF by default. 2014-08-22T17:31:28+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added size and speed optimisations to the speller compilation process: remove-epsilons, push-weights, determinise and minimise. Together this made the KAL speller *much* smaller and *much* faster. It is now as fast and small as any other fst-based speller. 2014-08-22T09:09:54+00:00
> forms of eikeegi 2014-08-21T12:03:25+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Hyperminimisation seems to be stable now, and I have added it as a standard configuration option. Also added autoconf support for the preliminary tool hfst-proc2, to facilitate easier testing of the tokeniser/analyser. 2014-08-21T08:45:06+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Updated the tagset targets to support Xerox fst's, and tagset replacement using regexes instead of the hfst-only relabel tool. Now all languages can get localised analysis and generation tags by adding a regex file and specifying a few targets. 2014-08-19T16:34:45+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added build step to explicitly convert hfst transducers to optimised lookup format. Whitespace changes in the silent rule variables. Included the new lookup-include file in src-dir-include.am. 2014-08-19T11:26:55+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Extracting flag diacritics, to build regexes that can ignore them in certain cases (like optional initial upper case). Requires new version of the gtd core. At the same time split tag extraction in two - the first step extracts the whole sigma set, and from that we can extract tags, flag diacritics, etc. The sigma set extraction was greatly improved, removing a number of small errors due to handling of reserved symbols in Hfst and Xfst. 2014-05-26T07:42:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added test summary for all yaml tests for a given fst. 2014-05-19T06:37:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] With feedback from Brendan I finally got the number of tests passed and failed printed as part of the YAML testing. 2014-05-16T00:55:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Adaption to a new version of the morph-tester.py script by Brendan Molloy. Small adjustments to the yaml test printouts. 2014-05-15T21:40:20+00:00
> Updated the status of some test scripts, so that 'make check' can go through on all languages. Some tests are now clean, others have become dirty again. 2014-05-13T05:12:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Major bug fix to the generate lemma test script. Now it actually checks that the generated lemmas correspond to the listed ones. Several of the languages had local modifications. Those are brought forward to the new version, to my best effort. 2014-05-12T20:18:44+00:00
> [Templage merge - und] Bugfix: no hardcoded language codes. 2014-05-12T11:25:23+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Now also (language pair independent) morphological generators for Apertium are installed with their correct Apertium file names. 2014-05-12T10:56:35+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added renaming to Apertium style filenames, changed installation file list to only include files actually used by Apertium. With this change, everything should be in place for a fully automatic integration between the GT-Divvun infrastructure and the Apertium infrastructure through the use of pkg-config files, with one exception: morphological generators. 2014-05-12T07:19:57+00:00
> [Template merge - und] A rewritten pc file, with proper paths actually reflecting where things are installed, and with a shortened description to better fit the use of it. 2014-05-09T11:01:21+00:00
> [Template merge - und] We also need to install the pkg-config file... 2014-05-09T10:25:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] After a long discussion, the moniker 'giella' was chosen instead of gtdivvun. Changed datadir from $(datadir)/gtdivvun/* to $(datadir)/giella/*. Added a pkg-config file so that all installed resources can be found automatically. 2014-05-09T10:03:49+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Changed datadir from $(datadir)/hfst/* to $(datadir)/gtdivvun/*, as it is the directory used to install the gtdivvun products, and not only hfst transducers are installed. 2014-05-08T08:13:33+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Require Automake 1.11.6 to avoid errors caused by older Automake's. 2014-05-07T12:05:03+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Make semantic tags optional also for dict and oahpa generators. Added support for hfst fst's for dict and oahpa. 2014-04-29T07:08:58+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Make semantic tags optional for all generators. Fixes bug http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1854. 2014-04-29T05:58:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Uncommented the cg3-with-apertium-tags targets, increased the gtcore version number. 2014-04-28T14:36:03+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Started work on adding hyphenators. No substantial changes, just Automake conditionals. 2014-04-25T20:12:28+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Actually made the options --disable-analysers and --disable-generators do what they should, earlier they had no effect. Also renamed those options. Wrapped the filter targets in mt/tools/apertium/filters/ in apertium conditionals, so that they will only be built if the apertium option is enabled. Added separate configure.ac option to disable the transcriptors (the num2text family). 2014-04-25T11:34:46+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Make sure all tests are within conditionals - only run them if the fst's have been built. 2014-04-24T16:19:26+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added conversion of analysis tags from GTDivvun format to Apertium format for the vislcg3 files. The generated vislcg3 files are not valid, and the targets are thus commented out for now. 2014-04-23T07:53:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for tmp files in the apertium target language specific analysers, to allow local processing of those analysers. Added more comments to explain the build process. 2014-04-17T06:30:25+00:00
> [Template update - und] Rewrote tag reordering of semantic tags to use a dynamically generated regex, and split tag reordering in three: reordering sub-POS tags, semantic tags, and language specific tags. The two first reordering operations are done on all languages. The reordering is done when building the raw file, to build a fixed tag order that other fst operations can rely on. The raw file build had to be split in two steps because of this. 2014-04-16T10:06:12+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for target-language specific filtering for the Apertium analysers. 2014-04-15T16:06:41+00:00
> [Template merge - und] A major update to the Apertium fst building: * corrected broken logic when building the list of tags used by a language * build filter to remove derivation strings dynamically from the list of tags * added a new taglist2remove...strings-regex.sh file to the core * added a new dir filters/ within tools/mt/apertium/ for building apertium specific filters * added facility to modify locally remove...strings.regex files by using an exception file * build the remove-derivation-strings.regex dynamically also for regular fst's 2014-04-15T13:19:37+00:00
> Corrected path to yaml testfiles. 2014-04-13T06:57:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Now building the remove dialect tag filter dynamically, in the same way as done for the semantic tags. Requires a new version of the GTD core. 2014-04-11T09:48:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Dialect tags are now removed in the Apertium fst compilation. In addition, tags can now be custom changed and reordered on a language pair basis, see README.txt in tools/mt/apertium/tagsets/. 2014-04-10T15:06:42+00:00
> plamk-style non-compounds for hfst. make check succeeds, btw 2014-04-10T14:25:48+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected several errors in the MT Apertium fst builds: now removing semantic tags and tags for originating language. Silent hfst-invert. 2014-04-10T09:37:39+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Modified the gttags.txt target to produce output also in cases where no GTD tags are defined (this is the case in some of the experimental languages). Earlier the build would break in this case. 2014-04-10T07:37:13+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Commented out another debug echo statement. 2014-04-09T07:34:09+00:00
> Moved yaml files, updated list of expected fails. All tests go through (some with expected fails to be corrected in the source code). 2014-04-09T06:49:20+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Commented out a debug echo statement. 2014-04-08T19:07:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug with optional semantic tags: we built the regex, but not the fst's. 2014-04-08T11:09:21+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a bug in the lexc yaml testing. Fixed file refs in the dict fst tests. 2014-04-07T08:43:18+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved yaml test scripts for different transducer types up one level, to correspond to the parallel location of the fst files in the build tree. 2014-04-03T11:30:12+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Generalised the yaml test runner code, to automatically identify the relative paths of the test scripts and the fst's being tested, so that all sorts of fst's can be tested irrespective of where they are built. Added yaml testing for MT/Apertium. 2014-04-03T09:55:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved some back-end scripts for yaml testing to the uppermost test directory, to ease sharing of the same code across test subdirectories. Updated paths to the new location. 2014-04-02T12:44:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved all silencing code to a separate include file (except in a few cases of double includes). Made the yaml testing a bit more verbose when rerunning individual tests (copy-paste testing). 2014-04-02T10:44:33+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Changed target language specifc analysers to be based off of analyser-mt-gt-desc.hfst, instead of the *.tmp.hfst file, to allow local post processing to be applied in the step from *.tmp.hfst to the *.hfst file. 2014-04-02T06:44:53+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Forgot to remove all the targets and build instructions in the old location. 2014-04-01T15:43:08+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Finalised moving the Apertium MT build code to the new location. All parts have been generalised, and the set of target languages to go with a specific source language (when analysing) is specified in configure.ac. That is, just list your target languages in configure.ac, and off you go. One feature still missing: target language derivation (and other) string filtering for the source language analyser. Coming soon. 2014-04-01T14:36:20+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Reorganised MT fst building, moving it to a new dir in tools/. This is done to avoid too much stuff in one dir (src/), and to make it easier to extend the MT support without making the build files too large for one dir. 2014-03-31T14:08:46+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a tmp-file step for the raw fst, to allow local/language specific overrides when building the raw transducer. Required for Estionan. 2014-03-26T20:39:26+00:00
> Trond and I simultaneously solved the problem in different ways. Trond's solution is more restricted, so we go with that one for now. 2014-03-26T20:11:35+00:00

> [Template merge - und] Added support for dialectal fst's in Oahpa. The dialect tags need only be specified in $GTLANG/configure.ac, and all filters and fst's will be constructed automatically. 2014-03-25T18:02:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made generated regex files build and be retained, as well as deleted when using 'make clean'. 2014-03-24T21:42:07+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added missing test runners, and at the same time made the test XFAILS (i.e. expected fails due to immature code). This commit completes the dictionary compilation update. 2014-03-24T18:41:35+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Greatly improved support for the dictionary fst building: * filtering semantic tags now work properly (removed for all but Prop) * properly silent when using silent builds * added dict-specific yaml test files and corresponding test runners * removed building of reduntant dictionary fst's since we now can test   generation and analysis independently - we only test the fst's we   are actually going to use, in the intended "direction"; this should   noticably speed up compilation, especially when using hfst * all languages now build a dictionary analyser with a mobile phone   spell relax Also removed semantic tags from the regular analyser, as discussed earlier. Increased the required GTD core version, as the new version is required to fix the bug mentioned above. 2014-03-24T17:12:05+00:00
> Topics for meeting. 2014-03-24T14:42:30+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected the test that triggers a FAIL in the twolc negative test script. 2014-03-20T14:21:36+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Temporarily add the new twolc pair tests to XFAIL-TESTS, to make them pass as expected fails. This will let all tests run, but will have to be reverted either when all broken twolc tests are fixed, or when the full test suite can be run without stopping make. 2014-03-20T07:17:22+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Rewrote the test for awk to check for a feature found only in GNU awk, and use the one found. Will check both awk and gawk, and use whichever supports the feature (gawk on some Linux systems is renamed awk). This should make the build configuration more robust. 2014-03-19T08:19:07+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added twolc pair string testing for Xerox. Hfst requires another type of pair strings, and can't easily be tested at present. 2014-03-18T13:41:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added more tailored silent output, silenced Xerox tools as much as possible (not very much). 2014-03-17T13:17:58+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made documentation build process work properly when using VPATH builds, and at the same time silenced the doc build by default. 2014-03-17T09:33:10+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Replaced grep in Makefile with a shell script for extracting semantic tags. This is done to catch the case where there are no semantic tags to extract. Earlier this caused a failed build, now it is handled properly. Required GTD core version increased because of the new script is only found in the latest version of the core. 2014-03-14T11:18:12+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Build remove-semantic-tags.regex for all languages, since we now use it when building speller files. 2014-03-14T10:04:25+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Only test spellers if we build spellers. 2014-03-14T09:51:34+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a test to check zhfst file validity. Not functional yet, because of a bug in hfst-ospell. 2014-03-14T08:53:04+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed bug http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1830. The word border mark removal had earlier been moved from a preceding step to the final product compilation step. It was added to the foma speller compilation, but not included in the hfst speller compilation for some reason. Now it is. 2014-03-13T10:10:27+00:00
> Tests and questions 2014-03-06T09:06:57+00:00
> [Template merge - und] r89769 : Fixed a build bug: it tried to build oxt files also when hfst support was not enabled. Now oxt files will only be built if hfst is on, and spellers have been requested. 2014-03-04T10:14:00+00:00
> Fixed syntax error. 2014-03-01T22:49:34+00:00
> Real import, first steps 2014-03-01T12:21:56+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a problem with building zhfst files using VPATH builds. 2014-02-28T15:34:23+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added convenience upload target to upload the oxt files and make a permanent link to the latest version. 2014-02-28T09:24:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Simplified the building of the hfst lexical transducer, and made it easy to use the -F option to hyperminimise the lexical fst. Using pattern rules instead of fixed filenames. 2014-02-27T22:50:36+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added first working build of oxt files. Not yet generalised, but working with the paths we have. Will build Windows and Mac OXT files for all languages. 2014-02-27T21:03:54+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Whitespace change. 2014-02-25T12:44:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Stop with error if --with-hfst was requested but could not be turned on. Based on patch by Unhammer. 2014-02-25T12:14:44+00:00
> Dummy file from template, just to satisfy the compilation requirements. 2014-02-18T11:41:46+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Really fixed syntax errors, and another old error. 2014-02-13T22:56:54+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed syntax errors. 2014-02-13T22:44:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] More comments and clear separation between the different macro sections. Added first components for configuring oxt building - checking whether it is possible to sync the oxt template locally from $GTHOME. Added check that all components of the Xerox tools are installed before enabling Xerox builds. 2014-02-13T22:32:47+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a variable to hold the LibreOffice version number where speller support for a language was initially available. 2014-02-13T18:19:21+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Made minimisation of speller automatas configurable (default=no), since it can be extremely time and resource consuming for some languages, and the size difference for the final fst is not very big; we might loose some speed thoug, which needs to be tested. Reorganised the configure.ac coce by moving most code to the m4/giellatekno.m4 macro file. What remains in configure.ac is pretty clean and mostly easily understood. 2014-02-13T17:00:39+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed the last files in am-shared/ to follow the correct naming scheme. 2014-02-12T19:37:30+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed test-src-morph-include.am - it was in reality empty. 2014-02-12T15:37:23+00:00
> Moved word border removal to each fst-based speller, as we need it in the hfst speller production (for word-based weighting) but not in the foma-based speller. Rewrote all (fst-)speller build steps to regexes instead of hfst pipelines. 2014-02-12T13:14:35+00:00
> [Template update - und] Rewrote the mt build instructions to a regex instead of an hfst pipe. Functionality is the same, but 40 lines of code disappeared, and the new code is much easier to read. 2014-02-12T09:56:23+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed doc-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-12T08:11:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed hunspell-include and listbased-spellchecker-include. 2014-02-12T06:42:19+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed orthography-include.am and hyphenation-include.am to follow the naming scheme. Now all src-dir includes are renamed. Deleted unused include file. 2014-02-11T18:39:02+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed phonetics-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-11T15:33:10+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed syntax-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-11T15:13:58+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed transcriptions-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-11T15:03:40+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed phonology-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-11T14:40:48+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed disamb-include.am to follow the naming scheme. 2014-02-11T14:28:07+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed 130 lines of code, and made the code much more readable by replacing the long pipe of hfst commands with one regex pr target. The actual regex is a mirror copy of the xfst regex already in the file, which means that it is also very easy to maintain functional parity between the two architectures. 2014-02-11T13:45:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed the lexc include file to follow the correct naming convention. 2014-02-11T11:45:02+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed the main src include file to follow the correct naming convention. 2014-02-11T11:19:54+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Completed documentation for updating gtcore. 2014-02-07T15:51:16+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for building disamb-oriented fst's, which include the semantic tags. 2014-02-07T14:16:11+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected VPATH build of lexc files generated from xml. At the same time silenced the XSL processing a bit, and corrected a minor configure error for VPATH configurations. 2014-01-31T10:30:18+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Enabled compression of zhfst files again, it should now work across all platforms. Made filter regex compilation quiter for xfst, and made the silent mode more informative for filter compilation. 2014-01-31T08:46:59+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Make the the xfscript compilers quiet in silent mode, verbose in verbose mode. 2014-01-21T14:01:15+00:00
> [Template merge - und] When running LexC tests, if no tests were found, the test bench will now report that the whole test was skipped. Earlier it reported a pass. 2014-01-20T22:14:05+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Tailored silent build output for Vislcg3. 2014-01-20T20:48:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Increased the actual and required version number after a small bugfix in the speller version easter egg, to ensure all generated spellers have proper version info. 2014-01-20T19:04:36+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected a fatal bug for non-latin spell checkers: the error model contained one letter from the easter egg not found in the acceptor. This symbol mismatch is fatal for hfst-ospell, and caused all non-latin spellers to crash (the latin spellers would all have this symbol ('p') anyway, so no problem was noticed earlier). 2014-01-19T16:23:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Corrected the compilation of xfscript files such that we still have a general build rule for xfscript files, but now with a following inversion when needed. Also added better feedback on the build steps in silent mode. 2014-01-17T09:37:15+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Updated required and actual version number of gtdcore. The easter egg creation for hfst spellers depends on new files in the core, and also the abbr.txt building does so. Without an updated core e.g. speller builds will fail. 2014-01-15T14:16:08+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed more am-shared files. 2014-01-15T13:56:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Renamed topdir-include.am to src-include.am to follow the correct naming pattern. 2014-01-14T16:56:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Experimenting with feedback on silent builds (make V=0). Looks good. 2014-01-14T16:44:00+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added Autotools support for building the abbr.txt file. This file is _not_ included in the regular make commands, one has to cd into the tools/preprocess/ directory, and to 'make abbr' there. This is on purpose. 2014-01-14T13:59:32+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added a new dir tools/preprocess/ to hold resources for the preprocess utility. 2014-01-14T08:32:20+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added automatic switch between hfst-foma and hfst-xfst for compiling xfscript files into transducers. hfst-foma is the default, with fallback to hfst-xfst if hfst-foma is not found. There are still issues with hfst-xfst. 2014-01-13T15:37:44+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Moved xfscript compilation out of phonetics-include and hyphenation include. These am-files contained and invert command that combined with an invert command in the actual xfscripts created a meaningless double inversion. 2014-01-13T14:40:29+00:00
> Removed all instances of 'invert net' in xfscript files. In reality it was a double inversion in almost all cases: first inversion within the xfscript, followed by an inversion in the command given to xfst. This double inversion made it impossible to unify otherwise identical operations for the same set of files, and would generally cause confusion as to what was going on. 2014-01-13T14:13:56+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed unused twolc.am file. Reorganised the code for twolc and xfscript compilation, to avoid duplicate code and prepare for improvements. Added M4 macro check that either hfst-xfst or hfst-foma is included, hfst compilation is turned off if none of them is. 2014-01-13T13:21:03+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Reduced weights for the easter egg suggestions, to avoid other suggestions to come in between. 2014-01-12T14:26:09+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Easter egg with version info now working in the hfst spellers. 2014-01-12T11:39:04+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added initial version file for the hfst-based spellers. 2014-01-10T16:25:56+00:00
> Explicit support for local source files and targets for the syntax. 2014-01-10T08:52:27+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added support for building (compiling into binary form) cg3 files for syntactic functions and dependency graphs. Added a template file for syntactic functions. Made the compiled binary files installable through 'make install'. 2014-01-10T08:22:51+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added version checking of vislcg3, renamed a couple of variables, and improved configuration feedback a bit. Now we require a vislcg3 new enough to not complain about recent addition of new features. 2014-01-07T14:32:54+00:00
> Initial import of parts of plamk: commit b1865e0face87ca00c9731579c30cd83e14732fa 2014-01-02T14:02:20+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Changed the file order when building zhfst files - there are still issues caused by the index.xml file being non-first. Now it is always first. 2013-12-20T11:02:17+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Finally fixed the libvoikko/zhfst spellers. Ready for Windows! 2013-12-20T09:27:13+00:00
> [Template merge - und; core reorg] Moved the common src/filters/ inside a common/ dir, to allow for other parallel dirs like smi/ and und-Cyrl/ that target only a subset of the languages. At the same time renamed gtshared/ to gtdshared/. This change requires version 0.2.0 of the gtdcore, which is part of this commit. 2013-12-19T08:58:23+00:00
> Removed the OLANG/XXX tag also from dict generators, not only from analysers. 2013-12-18T22:23:39+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Fixed a bug that hindered the GTD core from finding the version info script in the core (as opposed to installed). 2013-12-18T12:52:38+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added version checking of the GTD core: if the core is too old, configure will stop and print an error message with instructions on how to proceed. Added an external Autoconf M4 macro for version comparison, and renamed the file of an existing module, to be more consistent and explicit in the filenames. 2013-12-18T12:25:42+00:00
> Removed the filter "remove-NG-string.regex" from the analyser-dict-gt-norm.xfst target, in order to allow Use/NG entries in dict fsts. 2013-12-17T13:38:03+00:00
> [Template merge - und] No PCDATA text elements should be on a line of its own, that seems to trip off TinyXML2. 2013-12-14T00:40:54+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Another whitespace change to make TinyXML2 happy. 2013-12-13T13:48:35+00:00
> More white space changes 2013-12-13T12:38:35+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Removed a space that tripped off TinyXML2. Tiny typo correction. 2013-12-13T11:51:55+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added some default content to the description element, to avoid hfst-ospell to segfault. Corrected e-mail address, some other small corrections. 2013-12-11T22:41:06+00:00

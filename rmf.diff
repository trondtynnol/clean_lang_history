All pieces are in place for building everything in tools/spellcheckers/ only, and everything has been tested with one language, including make check (a few tests are skipped because the fst is not found, but no tests break). The old files are kept for the moment, in case unseen issues and missing data is popping up after the switch, but will be deleted after verification. 2020-05-08T18:28:19+00:00

> [Template merge - langs/und] First round of improved handling of compilation errors in shell pipes: instruct make to delete targets when some of the intermediate steps fail. 2019-01-11T13:53:26+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Added configure.ac conditional to control whether spellers for alternative orthographies are built. The default is 'true'. Set this to 'false' for historical or other orthographies for which a speller is not relevant. 2019-01-09T10:41:17+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Fix broken hfst builds of xfscript files when there is no final newline in the source file (caused the save command to be shaddowed by the final line of text, usually a comment, so no file was saved, and thus there was nothing to work on for the next build step). 2019-01-09T08:59:21+00:00
> [Template merge - langs/und] Apply alternate orthography conversion after hyphenation marks have been removed, but before the morphology marks are deleted. Especially word boundaries are useful for certain types of conversion, but other borders will likely be useful as well. The conversion scripts need to take the border marks into consideration. 2019-01-08T08:59:35+00:00

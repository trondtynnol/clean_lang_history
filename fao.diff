> Added warning about missing YAML testing, with short instructions on how to enable them. Template update. 2012-09-25T06:19:32+00:00
> The top-level syntax include AM file had not been changed to reflect the rle->cg3 suffix change. Merge from template. 2012-09-21T10:37:43+00:00
> Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file references more robust. Update from template. This also clears any warnings left over from the cg3 file renaming, such that we get a clean merge in the next template update. 2012-09-20T09:26:56+00:00
> The VislCG3 team has lately switched to a *.cg3 suffix. Now we do the same in the new infra - the new suffix is definitely more transparent. 2012-09-19T18:26:12+00:00
> Variables=cleaner code. Update from the template. 2012-09-18T06:56:51+00:00
> Updated the yaml test runner to properly report the exit value of the yaml tests, and also to give directions for how to see the details of each test if it failed. Update from the template. 2012-09-17T14:10:42+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00
> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00
> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> Enable yaml tests by magic. Merge from the template. 2012-09-14T11:54:49+00:00
> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00
> Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form. 2012-09-10T10:37:35+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. 2012-09-10T09:30:47+00:00
> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. This makes compilation much easier, and should cause the present makefile to actually build spellers. Tommi already did this for FIN. 2012-09-10T09:25:01+00:00
> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00
> SETs, not LISTs 2012-09-08T17:31:37+00:00
> Add missing src to hfst spellchecker automaton path. Merge from template. 2012-09-08T13:00:22+00:00
> Added vehtag lexicon. Note: No +Veh tag. 2012-09-08T09:29:45+00:00
> Search-replace error. The - in lexiconnames had been replaced by _, but also where it should not have been. 2012-09-08T09:27:34+00:00
> Added missing reference to dialect tag filter. Update from the template. 2012-09-08T08:42:58+00:00
> Updated my simplistic noun generation script to be aware of its new location. 2012-09-07T14:48:50+00:00
> Reorganised the test dir, in anticipation of a larger set of tools and source types in need of testing. Merge from the template. 2012-09-07T13:49:17+00:00
> Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox lookup tool. 2012-09-07T06:27:36+00:00
> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00
> Autoconf updates from the template. Intended goal: better hfst testing before enabling it. 2012-08-30T05:39:16+00:00
> Added border removal to the basic analyser and generator, such that they become useful. Also changed the order of the dir processing in src/, to ensure that the filters are built before they are needed. 2012-08-29T03:12:39+00:00

> Corrected syntax error. 2012-08-29T01:46:18+00:00
> Made the first test script more robust: it bails out if no transducer is found, and gives basic feedback to whether it is testing Xerox or Hfst. The test data files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected if needed, even after a successful test run. 2012-08-29T01:34:20+00:00
> Added the first test script: it tests whether noun lemmas do generate. The script does contain some language-specific bits, and must thus be adapted to the requirements of each language. 2012-08-29T00:17:53+00:00

> Added build support for xml source files. Updates from the template. 2012-08-27T07:33:38+00:00
> Added initial support for xml source files. NB! The support isn't fully according to GNU (autotools) standards yet, but will have to do for the moment. 2012-08-25T07:24:18+00:00
> A lot of cleanup and corrections: * suffix rules in more places (although not in all - that is not possible) * removed automake warning about pattern rules - we need them * checked all *-include.am files for consistency, added missing Xerox and HFST targets were needed, corrected vars to HFST tools, added comments and generally made the files easier to maintain (I hope). 2012-08-24T13:13:59+00:00

> Almost there - applied the changes from core, but got a syntax error. 2012-06-21T14:53:52+00:00
> Latest merge update from core (only changed the timestamp file - the affected file was already corrected locally). 2012-06-21T08:50:35+00:00
> Finally managed to merge changes to the Automake and M4 files from core to FAO, with the help of an updated merge script by Tommi, and better understanding of the merge process on my part. 2012-06-21T08:46:44+00:00

> Whitespace changes only, for better readability. 2012-06-19T09:58:56+00:00
> Forgot about a syntax requirement of xfst: no newline directly after the variable name. Now it compiles. 2012-06-19T09:52:48+00:00
> We don't need both an xfst regex and an xfst script file for the same purpose. Deleting the regex, and keeping the xfst script file. Updated the script file to be completely equivalent to the regex file that's deleted. 2012-06-19T09:45:09+00:00
> Updated FAO with filter support - first instance is sub-form filtering to create normative transducers. 2012-05-24T13:59:29+00:00
> Brought fao in line with the core template. The automatic updates did not work, but should hopefully work after these changes. The only changes in this file are additional comments. 2012-05-10T07:44:55+00:00

> Corrected a very resistent definiteness error. 2009-02-28T22:17:15+00:00
> Added tag Guess, and made a rule removing Guess if any non-Guess reading is available. Also made a rule removing the noun reading of _at_ in non-NP contexts. 2009-02-28T21:36:35+00:00
> Added a sublexicon guess, and a regular expression guessing names (see last check-in). The regex picks words containing initial capita letter, then any number of any foreign (incl. Danish) letter, but at least one vowel, and finally the final letter must be non-faroese (mostly non-alveolar). The result is sent to a case lexicon, NAD are basic, and G comes with an s. The outcome seems promising (but can of course not be used in normative contexts). 2009-02-28T21:34:35+00:00

> Added more context possibilites to "Deleting v in gv sequence", %^VDEL has more dummys to the left. Changed U-umlaut in Front of Nasal, the point is that EPH and extra vowel go together. Commented out right context to the right of %^IUML in the geheral "I-umlaut" rule. Added ú shortening to the Vx:Vy set of "tem Vowel Shortening in Supine and Pariciple", it was needed for flúgva s41. 2008-07-11T14:09:32+00:00

> Minor change. Main issue was that I forgot to remove tghe parentheses of the first line of "U-umlaut in Front of Nasal". Was:  a:o <=> _ Nas (Cns:) (Vow:) (Cns:) (%^EPH:) %^UUML: ; Should be, and is now:  a:o <=> _ Nas (Cns:)  Vow: (Cns:)  %^EPH: %^UUML: ; Without it, we still had the conflict with Epenthetic deletion. 2008-07-11T11:46:11+00:00

> Change to introduce strong/weak distinction also for neuters. h1, h2, h24, h25, h26 all got new stems, and therefore also correspondingly new continuation lexica. Neuter got separate -W lexica, just as masculine earlier. We distinguished between "Danis" -ir plural and Faroese -i pluaral, only the latter goes to definite form. 2008-07-08T12:52:31+00:00

All in all, the then-introduced rules -"Deleting initial i in definite suffix" and -"Deleting initial i in definite suffix after wowel, ð or g last in stem" must be revised.

> Variables=cleaner code. Update from the template. 2012-09-18T06:56:51+00:00
> Updated the yaml test runner to properly report the exit value of the yaml tests, and also to give directions for how to see the details of each test if it failed. Update from the template. 2012-09-17T14:10:42+00:00
> Corrected typo in shell scripts. 2012-09-17T11:03:08+00:00
> Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the availability of test data for the lemma and replaced all hard-coded file refs with variables in the noun generation test. 2012-09-17T09:30:31+00:00
> Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable. Update from template. 2012-09-17T08:14:29+00:00
> Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof and avoid annoying (and useless) warning from chmod. Added AC variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC. 2012-09-17T07:37:40+00:00
> Corrected error in previous commit. Finally things are working as they should. It might be necessary to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before compilation is running smoothly again. 2012-09-15T12:52:14+00:00
> Forgot to update configure.ac. 2012-09-15T10:43:23+00:00
> Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses (= removes false alarms). Merge from template. 2012-09-15T08:17:53+00:00
> Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script. If there are yaml files in that dir, they will be automatically run by 'make check'. 2012-09-14T19:28:03+00:00
> I intended to rename the files when I moved them, but forgot to do it. Now done. 2012-09-14T13:40:27+00:00

> Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology. 2012-09-14T11:27:52+00:00
> Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available to us, and skip them if not. 2012-09-14T10:54:10+00:00
> Fjerna LA i kommentarene. De ble lagt til for 1,5 år, for å skille hvilke ord Lene arbeidet med, og hvilke ord Trond arbeidet med. Det er siden gjort mange forandringer, dermed har ikke signaturen noen funksjon, den kan tvert imot være forvirrende. 2012-09-13T21:31:07+00:00

> Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the zhfst guidelines. This makes compilation much easier, and should cause the present makefile to actually build spellers. Tommi already did this for FIN. 2012-09-10T09:25:01+00:00
> Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for (auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of extra waiting time. 2012-09-10T09:00:36+00:00

7440a7413,7464
> Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox lookup tool. 2012-09-07T06:27:36+00:00
> Replaced "open -a SubEthaEdit" with the command line tool 'see'. Should be more robust, but it does of course require that you have SubEthaEdit (and its command line tool) installed. 2012-09-07T05:57:45+00:00
> Major template update of all languages (except those already updated by Jack): * proper tag deletion of tags only used for transducer manipulation, not for analysis (manipulations mostly not yet implemented) * making optional some tag sets for the generators * updated README with correct and working instructions for first time installers, also for svn users * added hooks for easily adding language-specific operations on transducers * silenced the und.timestamp message unless you are a GTMAINTAINER (thanks to Tommi) => more synchronized template merges, less noise for regular users * a number of other small fixes 2012-09-06T19:19:58+00:00

> Reverting the copy source file step for $GTCORE/gtshare/src/filters/, replacing it with direct compilation. The main reason for copying was to have the source files available for distribution, but that is not required, since the distribution and installations of the languages depends on the presence of GTCORE. Instead we risk that people start to add the copied source files to svn. 2012-09-04T16:13:32+00:00

> Changed the sources to what it was in the old infrastructure at revision 59359. At that point (+ one single manual correction), the shell script/lemma generation tests produced one single error (in a multiword name, probably due to a bug in the test script). Thus, that revision can be taken as a reference point. I will restore the present state as a separate checkin, so this commit serves as a temporary transition to get the check point in the new infrastructure, such that we can use the new testing tools to more easily check the differences between then and now. 2012-08-30T12:29:08+00:00
> Autoconf updates from the template. Intended goal: better hfst testing before enabling it. 2012-08-30T05:39:16+00:00
> Added .txt to all text files produced by the test. This will make it easy to ignore them, and to clean them. Also corrected the expression for reporting fail or not for the test to make. 2012-08-29T21:47:38+00:00
> Added the new noun test script to the TESTS variable, so that it will be run each time. 2012-08-29T21:25:12+00:00

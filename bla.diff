> [Template merge - und] Xerox will now stop on lexc syntax errors (done by replacing lexc with xfst - it was impossible to get lexc to stop; this is also how it is done in the old infrastructure). Hfst will not until (hfst_)foma is fixed, because foma doesn't stop on syntax errors. But one is better than none. 2013-11-22T13:10:38+00:00

Weighted speller automata are now the default (change the weights and what is weighted as needed pr. language). Thanks to Krister Lindén for giving instructions on how to get this working. 2013-11-15T09:25:30+00:00

Now we can allow version 1.11, and still get the pretty output we want in newer automakes. * Fixed references to GTCORE in test scripts. Earlier we relied solely on it beingset in the environment, now we take it from configure (which can take it from the environment or from a script). 2013-10-21T14:28:09+00:00

> [Template merke - und] The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure. Part 1 - no actual shell script, no Makefile. Comming in the next commit. NB! Right now making and building will break, sorry for the inconvenience. 2013-10-17T15:51:01+00:00
> [Template merge - und] Added option to automatically create a language home dir environment variable. The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give a warning). As part of this change, I switched the shell from sh to bash, as I don't know how portable the extra code is with respect to other shells. 2013-10-17T07:56:17+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Changed back the Automake requirement to 1.11 - 1.12 is creating too much trouble. We'll have to see what to do with the test output - the version requirements change must be followed by another change that will substantially degrade test reports on newer automakes. 2013-10-16T17:19:36+00:00
> [Template merke - und:] Made the check for GTCORE functional, looking for both the gt-core.sh script (and using its output if found), and the environment variable $GTCORE. This means that there is no need anymore to set the GTCORE variable as long as one configure, make and make install in the gtcore directory. 2013-10-16T16:50:46+00:00

> Template merge: Remove copying of the timestamp file for non-maintainers. It breaks the automatic merge, and requires a revision-explicit merge for each such language. Also added removal of originating language tags - they are only used in TTS. 2013-10-04T07:05:34+00:00
> Added compilation of the remove-orig_lang-tags filter. Sorted the filter targets alphabetically within each logical block. Template merge. 2013-10-04T05:20:26+00:00

> Template merge: Changed the default setup to only include morphological analysis and generation. This is done to reduce the build time during regular development.
